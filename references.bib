  abstract = {The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates the effects of the environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Recently, AHR has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer by virtue of its ability to modulate estrogen receptor-α (ERα) signalling and/or its ability to block cell proliferation. Our previous studies identified cyclin G2 (CCNG2), an inhibitor of cell-cycle progression, as an AHR target gene; however, the mechanism of this regulation is unknown. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in T-47D human breast cancer cells revealed a TCDD-dependent recruitment of AHR, nuclear co-activator 3 (NCoA3) and the transcription factor forkhead box A1 (FOXA1), a key regulator of breast cancer cell signaling, to CCNG2 resulting in increases in CCNG2 mRNA and protein levels. Mutation of the AHR response element (AHRE) and forkhead-binding sites abolished TCDD-induced CCNG2-regulated reporter gene activity. RNA interference–mediated knockdown of FOXA1 prevented the TCDD-dependent recruitment of AHR and NCoA3 to CCNG2 and reduced CCNG2 mRNA levels. Interestingly, knockdown of FOXA1 also caused a marked decrease in ERα, but not AHR protein levels. However, RNA interference–mediated knockdown of ERα, a negative regulator of CCNG2, had no effect on TCDD-dependent AHR or NCoA3 recruitment to or expression of CCNG2. These findings show that FOXA1, but not ERα, is essential for AHR-dependent regulation of CCNG2, assigning a role for FOXA1 in AHR action. Mol Cancer Res; 10(5); 636–48. ©2012 AACR.},

  abstract = {This article presents global cancer statistics by world region for the year 2022 based on updated estimates from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). There were close to 20 million new cases of cancer in the year 2022 (including nonmelanoma skin cancers [NMSCs]) alongside 9.7 million deaths from cancer (including NMSC). The estimates suggest that approximately one in five men or women develop cancer in a lifetime, whereas around one in nine men and one in 12 women die from it. Lung cancer was the most frequently diagnosed cancer in 2022, responsible for almost 2.5 million new cases, or one in eight cancers worldwide (12.4\% of all cancers globally), followed by cancers of the female breast (11.6\%), colorectum (9.6\%), prostate (7.3\%), and stomach (4.9\%). Lung cancer was also the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18.7\%), followed by colorectal (9.3\%), liver (7.8\%), female breast (6.9\%), and stomach (6.8\%) cancers. Breast cancer and lung cancer were the most frequent cancers in women and men, respectively (both cases and deaths). Incidence rates (including NMSC) varied from four-fold to five-fold across world regions, from over 500 in Australia/New Zealand (507.9 per 100,000) to under 100 in Western Africa (97.1 per 100,000) among men, and from over 400 in Australia/New Zealand (410.5 per 100,000) to close to 100 in South-Central Asia (103.3 per 100,000) among women. The authors examine the geographic variability across 20 world regions for the 10 leading cancer types, discussing recent trends, the underlying determinants, and the prospects for global cancer prevention and control. With demographics-based predictions indicating that the number of new cases of cancer will reach 35 million by 2050, investments in prevention, including the targeting of key risk factors for cancer (including smoking, overweight and obesity, and infection), could avert millions of future cancer diagnoses and save many lives worldwide, bringing huge economic as well as societal dividends to countries over the forthcoming decades.},

We have created a large collection of breast cancer patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTXs), in which the morphological and molecular characteristics of the originating tumor are preserved through passaging in the mouse. An integrated platform combining in~vivo maintenance of these PDTXs along with short-term cultures of PDTX-derived tumor cells (PDTCs) was optimized. Remarkably, the intra-tumor genomic clonal architecture present in the originating breast cancers was mostly preserved upon serial passaging in xenografts and in short-term cultured PDTCs. We assessed drug responses in PDTCs on a high-throughput platform and validated several ex~vivo responses in~vivo.

  abstract = {Most cancer genomic data are generated from bulk samples composed of mixtures of cancer subpopulations, as well as normal cells. Subclonal reconstruction methods based on machine learning aim to separate those subpopulations in a sample and infer their evolutionary history. However, current approaches are entirely data driven and agnostic to evolutionary theory. We demonstrate that systematic errors occur in the analysis if evolution is not accounted for, and this is exacerbated with multi-sampling of the same tumor. We present a novel approach for model-based tumor subclonal reconstruction, called MOBSTER, which combines machine learning with theoretical population genetics. Using public whole-genome sequencing data from 2,606 samples from different cohorts, new data and synthetic validation, we show that this method is more robust and accurate than current techniques in single-sample, multiregion and longitudinal data. This approach minimizes the confounding factors of nonevolutionary methods, thus leading to more accurate recovery of the evolutionary history of human cancers.},

We have investigated how these factors can stably occupy silent chromatin. Remarkably, we find that HNF3, but not GATA-4 or a GAL4 control protein, binds far more stably to nucleosome core particles than to free DNA. In the presence of HNF3, GATA-4 binds stably to an HNF3-positioned nucleosome. Histone acetylation does not affect HNF3 binding. This is evidence for stable nucleosome binding by a transcription factor and shows that a winged helix protein is sufficient to initiate the assembly of an enhancer complex on nonacetylated nucleosomes.},

  abstract = {Purpose Predicting the pattern of recurrence can aid in the development of targeted surveillance and treatment strategies. We identified patient populations that remain at risk for an event at a median follow-up of 24 years from the diagnosis of operable breast cancer. Patients and Methods International Breast Cancer Study Group clinical trials I to V randomly assigned 4,105 patients between 1978 and 1985. Annualized hazards were estimated for breast cancer–free interval (primary end point), disease-free survival, and overall survival. Results For the entire group, the annualized hazard of recurrence was highest during the first 5 years (10.4\%), with a peak between years 1 and 2 (15.2\%). During the first 5 years, patients with estrogen receptor (ER) – positive disease had a lower annualized hazard compared with those with ER-negative disease (9.9\% v 11.5\%; P = .01). However, beyond 5 years, patients with ER-positive disease had higher hazards (5 to 10 years: 5.4\% v 3.3\%; 10 to 15 years: 2.9\% v 1.3\%; 15 to 20 years: 2.8\% v 1.2\%; and 20 to 25 years: 1.3\% v 1.4\%; P {$<$} .001). Among patients with ER-positive disease, annualized hazards of recurrence remained elevated and fairly stable beyond 10 years, even for those with no axillary involvement (2.0\%, 2.1\%, and 1.1\% for years 10 to 15, 15 to 20, and 20 to 25, respectively) and for those with one to three positive nodes (3.0\%, 3.5\%, and 1.5\%, respectively). Conclusion Patients with ER-positive breast cancer maintain a significant recurrence rate during extended follow up. Strategies for follow up and treatments to prevent recurrences may be most efficiently applied and studied in patients with ER-positive disease followed for a long period of time.},

We find that chromothripsis events are pervasive across cancers, with a frequency of more than 50\% in several cancer types. Whereas canonical chromothripsis profiles display oscillations between two copy-number states, a considerable fraction of events involve multiple chromosomes and additional structural alterations. In addition to non-homologous end joining, we detect signatures of replication-associated processes and templated insertions. Chromothripsis contributes to oncogene amplification and to inactivation of genes such as mismatch-repair-related genes. These findings show that chromothripsis is a major process that drives genome evolution in human cancer.},

  abstract = {Objective Primary tumour location is regarded as a reliable surrogate of colorectal cancer biology. Sensitivity to anti-EGFRs (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) of metastatic transverse colon cancers (mTCCs) has usually been assumed similar to right-sided tumours; however, evidence about the clinical behaviour of mTCC is limited. Thus, to verify sensitivity of mTCC to anti-EGFRs we conducted the present study. Methods Patients with RAS/BRAF wild-type microsatellite stable (MSS) mTCC receiving anti-EGFR monotherapy, or in combination with irinotecan if clearly irinotecan-refractory, were included. Hypothesising an overall response rate (ORR) of 35\%, 11 patients, of whom at least 3 were responders, were necessary to be able to reject the null hypothesis of an ORR of 5\%, with α and β errors of 0.05 and 0.20. PRESSING panel and consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) were assessed on tumour samples, whereas in-silico data were obtained from TCGA dataset. Results Among nine eligible patients, four and three achieved response and disease stabilisation (ORR 44\%). At a median follow-up of 23.1 months, median progression-free survival and overall survival were 7.3 (95\% CI 3.9 to NA) and 15.0 months (95\% CI 10.0 to NA), respectively. A MET amplification and an ERBB4 S303F substitution were detected in patients with rapid disease progression, while others had PRESSING panel-negative tumours with CMS2 or CMS4 subtypes. Conclusions RAS/BRAF wild-type MSS mTCCs may be sensitive to anti-EGFRs, as confirmed by molecular analyses.},

By delineating expression outlier genes driven in cis by CNAs, we identified putative cancer genes, including deletions in PPP2R2A, MTAP and MAP2K4. Unsupervised analysis of paired DNA–RNA profiles revealed novel subgroups with distinct clinical outcomes, which reproduced in the validation cohort. These include a high-risk, oestrogen-receptor-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a favourable prognosis subgroup devoid of CNAs. Trans-acting aberration hotspots were found to modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including a TCR deletion-mediated adaptive immune response in the ‘CNA-devoid’ subgroup and a basal-specific chromosome 5 deletion-associated mitotic network. Our results provide a novel molecular stratification of the breast cancer population, derived from the impact of somatic CNAs on the transcriptome.},

We performed extensive multi-platform profiling of multi-regional metastases in autopsies from 10 patients with therapy-resistant breast cancer. The integrated genomic and immune landscapes show that metastases propagate and evolve as communities of clones, reveal their predicted neo-antigen landscapes, and show that they can accumulate HLA loss of heterozygosity (LOH). The data further identify variable tumor microenvironments and reveal, through analyses of T~cell receptor repertoires, that adaptive immune responses appear to co-evolve with the metastatic genomes.

Nearly all informative samples (95.1\%) contain evidence of distinct subclonal expansions with frequent branching relationships between subclones. We observe positive selection of subclonal driver mutations across most cancer types and identify cancer type-specific subclonal patterns of driver gene mutations, fusions, structural variants, and copy number alterations as well as dynamic changes in mutational processes between subclonal expansions. Our results underline the importance of ITH and its drivers in tumor evolution and provide a pan-cancer resource of comprehensively annotated subclonal events from whole-genome sequencing data.},

  abstract = {Background Based on its mechanism of action, PARP inhibitor therapy is expected to benefit mainly tumor cases with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). Therefore, identification of tumor types with increased HRD is important for the optimal use of this class of therapeutic agents. HRD levels can be estimated using various mutational signatures from next generation sequencing data and we used this approach to determine whether breast cancer brain metastases show altered levels of HRD scores relative to their corresponding primary tumor. Patients and methods We used a previously published next generation sequencing dataset of 21 matched primary breast cancer/brain metastasis pairs to derive the various mutational signatures/HRD scores strongly associated with HRD. We also carried out the myChoice HRD analysis on an independent cohort of 17 breast cancer patients with matched primary/brain metastasis pairs. Results All of the mutational signatures indicative of HRD showed a significant increase in the brain metastases relative to their matched primary tumor in the previously published whole exome sequencing dataset. In the independent validation cohort, the myChoice HRD assay showed an increased level in 87.5\% of the brain metastases relative to the primary tumor, with 56\% of brain metastases being HRD positive according to the myChoice criteria. Conclusions The consistent observation that brain metastases of breast cancer tend to have higher HRD measures may raise the possibility that brain metastases may be more sensitive to PARP inhibitor treatment. This observation warrants further investigation to assess whether this increase is common to other metastatic sites as well, and whether clinical trials should adjust their strategy in the application of HRD measures for the prioritization of patients for PARP inhibitor therapy.},

  abstract = {The NETO2 gene (neuropilin and tolloid-like 2) encodes a protein that acts as an accessory subunit of kainate receptors and is predominantly expressed in the brain. Upregulation of NETO2 has been observed in several tumors; however, its role in tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated NETO2 expression in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer using quantitative PCR (qPCR), as well as the effect of shRNA-mediated NETO2 silencing on transcriptome changes in colorectal cancer cells. In the investigated tumors, we observed both increased and decreased NETO2 mRNA levels, presenting no correlation with the main clinicopathological characteristics. In HCT116 cells, NETO2 knockdown resulted in the differential expression of 17 genes and 2 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), associated with the upregulation of circadian rhythm and downregulation of several cancer-associated pathways, including Wnt, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrated the possibility to utilize a novel model organism, short-lived fish Nothobranchius furzeri, for evaluating NETO2 functions. The ortholog neto2b in N. furzeri demonstrated a high similarity in nucleotide and amino acid sequences with human NETO2, as well as was characterized by stable expression in various fish tissues. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the deregulation of NETO2 in the breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer and its participation in the tumor development primarily through cellular signaling.},

Consequently, rectal tumors and stage IV tumors (possibly reflective of more aggressive disease) were underrepresented, and no chemo- and/or radiotherapy pretreated samples or metastatic lesions were included. In view of their possible effect on gene expression and consequently subtype classification, sample source and treatments received by the patients before collection must be carefully considered when applying the classifier to new datasets. Recently, several correlative analyses of clinical trials demonstrated the applicability of this classification to the metastatic setting, confirmed the prognostic value of CMS subtypes after relapse and hinted at differential sensitivity to treatments. Here, we discuss why contexts and equivocal factors need to be taken into account when analyzing clinical trial data, including potential selection biases, type of platform, and type of algorithm used for subtype prediction. This perspective article facilitates both our clinical and research understanding of the application of this classifier to expedite subtype-based clinical trials.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Metastatic colorectal cancers (mCRCs) assigned to the transit-amplifying (TA) CRCAssigner subtype are more sensitive to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy. We evaluated the association between the intratumoral presence of TA signature (TA-high/TA-low, dubbed as TA-ness classification) and outcomes in CRCs treated with anti-EGFR therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The TA-ness classes were defined in a discovery cohort (n = 84) and independently validated in a clinical trial (CO.20; cetuximab monotherapy arm; n = 121) and other samples using an established NanoString-based gene expression assay. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and disease control rate (DCR) according to TA-ness classification were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The TA-ness was measured in 772 samples from 712 patients. Patients (treated with anti-EGFR therapy) with TA-high tumors had significantly longer PFS (discovery hazard ratio [HR], 0.40; 95\% CI, 0.25 to 0.64; P {$<$} .001; validation HR, 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.45 to 0.93; P = .018), longer OS (discovery HR, 0.48; 95\% CI, 0.29 to 0.78; P = .003; validation HR, 0.67; 95\% CI, 0.46 to 0.98; P = .04), and higher DCR (discovery odds ratio [OR]; 14.8; 95\% CI, 4.30 to 59.54; P {$<$} .001; validation OR, 4.35; 95\% CI, 2.00 to 9.09; P {$<$} .001). TA-ness classification and its association with anti-EGFR therapy outcomes were further confirmed using publicly available data (n = 80) from metastatic samples (PFS P {$<$} .001) and patient-derived xenografts (P = .042). In an exploratory analysis of 55 patients with RAS/BRAF wild-type and left-sided tumors, TA-high class was significantly associated with longer PFS and trend toward higher response rate (PFS HR, 0.53; 95\% CI, 0.28 to 1.00; P = .049; OR, 5.88; 95\% CI, 0.71 to 4.55; P = .09; response rate 33\% in TA-high and 7.7\% in TA-low). CONCLUSION: TA-ness classification is associated with prognosis in patients with mCRC treated with anti-EGFR therapy and may further help understanding the value of sidedness in patients with RAS/BRAF wild-type tumors.},

  abstract = {The small GTPase Rac1 regulates many cellular processes, including cytoskeletal reorganization, cell migration, proliferation, and survival. Additionally, Rac1 plays a major role in activating NF-κB-mediated transcription. Both Rac1 and NF-κB regulate many properties of the malignant phenotype, including anchorage-independent proliferation and survival, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Despite these findings, the roles of Rac1and NF-κB in non-small cell lung carcinoma, a leading cause of cancer deaths, have not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we compared the effects of Rac1 siRNA to that of the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 on multiple features of the NSCLC malignant phenotype, including NF-κB activity. We show that the siRNA-mediated silencing of Rac1 in lung cancer cells results in decreased cell proliferation and migration. The decrease in proliferation was observed in both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent assays. Furthermore, cells with decreased Rac1 expression have a slowed progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. These effects induced by Rac1 siRNA correlated with a decrease in NF-κB transcriptional activity. Additionally, inhibition of NF-κB signaling with BAY 11–7082 inhibited proliferation; indicating that the loss of cell proliferation and migration induced by the silencing of Rac1 expression may be attributed in part to loss of NF-κB activity. Interestingly, treatment with the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 strongly inhibits cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and NF-κB activity in lung cancer cells, to an even greater extent than the inhibition induced by Rac1 siRNA. These findings indicate that Rac1 plays an important role in lung cancer cell proliferation and migration, most likely through its ability to promote NF-κB activity, and highlight Rac1 pathways as therapeutic targets for the treatment of lung cancer.},

Sequencing data from a single biopsy represent a snapshot of this process that can reveal the timing of specific genomic aberrations and the changing influence of mutational processes3. Here, by whole-genome sequencing analysis of 2,658 cancers as part of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium~of the~International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)4, we reconstruct the life history and evolution of mutational processes and driver mutation sequences of 38 types of cancer. Early oncogenesis is characterized by mutations in a constrained set of driver genes, and specific copy number gains, such as trisomy 7 in glioblastoma and isochromosome 17q in medulloblastoma. The mutational spectrum changes significantly throughout tumour evolution in 40\% of samples. A nearly fourfold diversification of driver genes and increased genomic instability are features of later stages. Copy number alterations often occur in mitotic crises, and lead to simultaneous gains of chromosomal segments. Timing analyses suggest that driver mutations often precede diagnosis by many years, if not decades. Together, these results determine the evolutionary trajectories of cancer, and highlight opportunities for early cancer detection.},

  abstract = {There are increasing reports of aberrant expression of GATA4, correlated with oncogenesis and malignant progression in some solid tumors, but whether GATA4 functions as an oncogenic driver or a tumor suppressor in carcinogenesis remains controversial. Because the role and mechanism of GATA4 in breast cancer (BrCa) remain poorly understood, we focused on the expression of GATA4 in BrCa cell lines and tissues and its mechanism in breast oncogenesis. Semiquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect expression of GATA4 in BrCa cell lines and adjacent breast tissues. Methylation statuses of the GATA4 promoter were studied using methylation-specific PCR in BrCa cell lines.The effects of GATA4 on proliferation, invasion, and cell cycle were also analyzed. Compared with adjacent breast tissue, GATA4 expression in BrCa tissue and cell lines was obviously lower and low expression levels of GATA4 predicted poor outcome. Methylation of GATA4 occurred in almost all of BrCa cell lines . GATA4 overexpression decreased viability, invasion, migration, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of MB-231 and BT549 cells, and markedly induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Exogenous expression GATA4 accompanied a significant alteration of MMP2, MMP3, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin expression and induction of the caspase-8 pathway. Moreover, GATA4 could directly repress RelA (p65) transcription, reduce the nuclear phosphorylation-p65 and upregulate inhibitor kappa B expression. Altogether, GATA4 plays a tumor-suppressive role via repression of NF-κB signaling in BrCa cells. Our findings suggest that GATA4 is a potential prognostic biomarker and gene therapeutic target for human BrCa.},

Advanced breast cancer with distant organ metastases is considered incurable with currently available therapies. On the molecular level, breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease; molecular features include activation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, encoded by ERBB2), activation of hormone receptors (oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) and/or BRCA mutations. Treatment strategies differ according to molecular subtype. Management of breast cancer is multidisciplinary; it includes locoregional (surgery and radiation therapy) and systemic therapy approaches. Systemic therapies include endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive disease, chemotherapy, anti-HER2 therapy for HER2-positive disease, bone stabilizing agents, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for BRCA mutation carriers and, quite recently, immunotherapy. Future therapeutic concepts in breast cancer aim at individualization of therapy as well as at treatment de-escalation and escalation based on tumour biology and early therapy response. Next to further treatment innovations, equal worldwide access to therapeutic advances remains the global challenge in breast cancer care for the future.},

Neuropilin and tolloid-like 2 (NETO2), a member of the subfamily of CUB domain and LDLa-containing proteins, has been suggested to be involved in tumor progression. Nevertheless, little is known about the function and molecular mechanism of NETO2 in NPC progression. In the study, NETO2 was found to be significantly up-regulated in clinical tissues and NPC cell lines. NETO2 expression was positively correlated with tumor size. NETO2 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in NPC cell lines. Significantly, NETO2 knockdown promoted the radiotherapy in~vitro, as evidenced by the further reduced cell proliferation and metastasis in NPC cells using 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), colony formation and transwell analysis. In addition, NETO2 inhibition markedly induced apoptosis in NPC cells through activating Caspase-3 signaling. Also, the knockdown of NETO2 obviously promoted the efficacy of radiotherapy in apoptosis induction, along with higher expression of cleaved Caspase-3. NETO2 knockdown-triggered apoptosis in NPC cells were considerably diminished by Caspase-3 inactivation, demonstrating the essential role of Caspase-3 in NETO2-regulated NPC development. Moreover, in~vivo experiments suggested that NETO2 knockdown promoted radiation-induced tumor growth suppression in the absence of significant side effects. Collectively, reducing NETO2 expression might elevate the efficiency of radiotherapy in NPC patients.},

Treated metastases often harbored private ‘driver’ mutations, whereas untreated metastases did not, suggesting that treatment promotes clonal evolution. Polyclonal seeding was common in untreated lymph node metastases (n\,=\,17 out of 29, 59\%) and distant metastases (n\,=\,20 out of 70, 29\%), but less frequent in treated distant metastases (n\,=\,9 out of 94, 10\%). The low number of metastasis-private clonal mutations is consistent with early metastatic seeding, which we estimated occurred 2–4 years before diagnosis across these cancers. Furthermore, these data suggest that the natural course of metastasis is selectively relaxed relative to early tumorigenesis and that metastasis-private mutations are not drivers of cancer spread but instead associated with drug resistance.},

The reassembly of fragmented chromosomes by error-prone DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair generates a spectrum of simple and complex genomic rearrangements that are associated with human cancers and disorders. How specific DSB repair pathways recognize and process these lesions remains poorly understood. Here we used CRISPR/Cas9 to systematically inactivate distinct DSB processing or repair pathways and interrogated the rearrangement landscape of fragmented chromosomes from micronuclei. Deletion of canonical non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) components, including DNA-PKcs, LIG4, and XLF, substantially reduced the formation of complex rearrangements and shifted the rearrangement landscape toward simple alterations without the characteristic patterns of cancer-associated chromothripsis. Following reincorporation into the nucleus, fragmented chromosomes localize within micronuclei bodies (MN bodies) and undergo successful ligation by NHEJ within a single cell cycle. In the absence of NHEJ, chromosome fragments were rarely engaged by polymerase theta-mediated alternative end-joining or recombination-based mechanisms, resulting in delayed repair kinetics and persistent 53BP1-labeled MN bodies in the interphase nucleus. Prolonged DNA damage signaling from unrepaired fragments ultimately triggered cell cycle arrest. Thus, we provide evidence supporting NHEJ as the exclusive DSB repair pathway generating complex rearrangements following chromothripsis from mitotic errors.},

Paired box family protein 8 (PAX8) has been described as a transcription factor highly specific to neoplasms derived from Mullerian organs, thyroid, and kidney. PAX8 IHC with polyclonal and monoclonal antibody reagents was performed on 27 primary and 22 metastatic breast carcinomas. Eight of 27 primary breast carcinomas (30\%) were positive for PAX8 with the monoclonal antibody reagent only; 0 of 22 were polyclonal anti-PAX8 immunoreactive. Substantial numbers of metastases had positive immunoreactivity for polyclonal anti-PAX8 (23\%).

IHC with monoclonal anti-PAX8 was positive on 6 of 7 primary breast carcinomas corresponding to PAX8-positive metastases. Together, these results indicate a significant fraction of breast carcinoma metastases and corresponding primary neoplasms have immunoreactivity for PAX8, and positivity rates depend on the antibody used. Diagnoses of metastatic breast carcinoma were achieved with the aid of clinical history and additional IHC in cases of PAX8 immunoreactivity.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) induces EMT through Smads, leading to transcriptional regulation, and through non-Smad pathways. We observe that TGF-β induces increased cell size and protein content during EMT. This translational regulation results from activation by TGF-β of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt, leading to the phosphorylation of S6 kinase 1 and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E–binding protein 1, which are direct regulators of translation initiation. Rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR complex 1, inhibits the TGF-β–induced translation pathway and increase in cell size without affecting the EMT phenotype. Additionally, rapamycin decreases the migratory and invasive behavior of cells that accompany TGF-β–induced EMT. The TGF-β–induced translation pathway through mTOR complements the transcription pathway through Smads. Activation of mTOR by TGF-β, which leads to increased cell size and invasion, adds to the role of TGF-β–induced EMT in cancer progression and may represent a therapeutic opportunity for rapamycin analogues in cancer.},

  abstract = {Focal copy-number amplification is an oncogenic event. Although recent studies have revealed the complex structure1-3 and the evolutionary trajectories4 of oncogene amplicons, their origin remains poorly understood. Here we show that focal amplifications in breast cancer frequently derive from a mechanism-which we term translocation-bridge amplification-involving inter-chromosomal translocations that lead to dicentric chromosome bridge formation and breakage. In 780 breast cancer genomes, we observe that focal amplifications are frequently connected to each other by inter-chromosomal translocations at their boundaries. Subsequent analysis indicates the following model: the oncogene neighbourhood is translocated in G1 creating a dicentric chromosome, the dicentric chromosome is replicated, and as dicentric sister chromosomes segregate during mitosis, a chromosome bridge is formed and then broken, with fragments often being circularized in extrachromosomal DNAs. This model explains the amplifications of key oncogenes, including ERBB2 and CCND1. Recurrent amplification boundaries and rearrangement hotspots correlate with oestrogen receptor binding in breast cancer cells. Experimentally, oestrogen treatment induces DNA double-strand breaks in the oestrogen receptor target regions that are repaired by translocations, suggesting a role of oestrogen in generating the initial translocations. A pan-cancer analysis reveals tissue-specific biases in mechanisms initiating focal amplifications, with the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle prevalent in some and the translocation-bridge amplification in others, probably owing to the different timing of DNA break repair. Our results identify a common mode of oncogene amplification and propose oestrogen as its mechanistic origin in breast cancer.},

  abstract = {Investigations into the function of nonpromoter DNA methylation have yielded new insights into epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of distinguishing between DNA methylation in discrete functional regions; however, integrated nonpromoter DNA methylation and gene expression analyses across a wide number of tumor types and corresponding normal tissues have not been performed. Through integrated analysis of gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, we examined 32 tumor types and identified 57 tumor suppressors and oncogenes out of 260 genes exhibiting a correlation of \&gt; 0.5 between gene body methylation and gene expression in at least one tumor type. The lymphocyte-specific gene CARD11 exhibits robust association between gene body methylation and expression across 19 of 32 tumor types examined. It is significantly overexpressed in kidney renal cell carcinoma (KIRC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumor tissues in comparison with respective control samples; and is significantly associated with lower overall survival in KIRC. Contrary to its canonical function in lymphocyte NFκB activation, CARD11 activates the mTOR pathway in KIRC and LUAD, resulting in suppressed autophagy. Furthermore, demethylation of a CpG island within the gene body of CARD11 decreases gene expression. Collectively, our study highlights how DNA methylation outside the promoter region can impact tumor progression.Our study describes a novel regulatory role of gene body DNA methylation–dependent CARD11 expression on mTOR signaling and its impact on tumor progression.},

Components of these pathways were among the first to be discovered when scientists began cloning proto-oncogenes and purifying cellular kinase activities in the 1980s. Ras-ERK and PI3K-mTOR were originally modeled as linear signaling conduits activated by different stimuli, yet even early experiments hinted that they might intersect to regulate each other and co-regulate downstream functions.

  abstract = {During development of the ventral spinal cord, the V2 interneurons emerge from p2 progenitors and diversify into two major subtypes, V2a and V2b, that play key roles in locomotor coordination. Dll4-mediated Notch activation in a subset of p2 precursors constitutes the crucial first step towards generating neuronal diversity in this domain. The mechanism behind the asymmetric Notch activation and downstream signaling events are, however, unknown at present. We show here that the Ascl1 and Neurog basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proneural factors are expressed in a mosaic pattern in p2 progenitors and that Foxn4 is required for setting and maintaining this expression mosaic. By binding directly to a conserved Dll4 enhancer, Foxn4 and Ascl1 activate Dll4 expression, whereas Neurog proteins prevent this effect, thereby resulting in asymmetric activation of Dll4 expression in V2 precursors expressing different combinations of proneural and Foxn4 transcription factors. Lineage tracing using the Cre-LoxP system reveals selective expression of Dll4 in V2a precursors, whereas Dll4 expression is initially excluded from V2b precursors. We provide evidence that BMP/TGFβ signaling is activated in V2b precursors and that Dll4-mediated Notch signaling is responsible for this activation. Using a gain-of-function approach and by inhibiting BMP/TGFβ signal transduction with pathway antagonists and RNAi knockdown, we further demonstrate that BMP/TGFβ signaling is both necessary and sufficient for V2b fate specification. Our data together thus suggest that the mosaic expression of Foxn4 and proneural factors may serve as the trigger to initiate asymmetric Dll4-Notch and subsequent BMP/TGFβ signaling events required for neuronal diversity in the V2 domain.},

By analyzing genomic and clinical data from this cohort, we identified associations between genomic alterations and patterns of metastatic dissemination across 50 tumor types. We found that chromosomal instability is strongly correlated with metastatic burden in some tumor types, including prostate adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and HR+/HER2+ breast ductal carcinoma, but not in others, including colorectal cancer and high-grade serous ovarian cancer, where copy-number alteration patterns may be established early in tumor development. We also identified somatic alterations associated with metastatic burden and specific target organs. Our data offer a valuable resource for the investigation of the biological basis for metastatic spread and highlight the complex role of chromosomal instability in cancer progression.},

  abstract = {MERTK, a member of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK) receptor tyrosine kinases, has complex and diverse roles in cell biology. On the one hand, knock-out of MERTK results in age-dependent autoimmunity characterized by failure of apoptotic cell clearance, while on the other, MERTK overexpression in cancer drives classical oncogene pathways leading to cell transformation. To better understand the interplay between cell transformation and efferocytosis, we stably expressed MERTK in human MCF10A cells, a non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line devoid of endogenous MERTK. While stable expression of MERTK in MCF10A resulted in enhanced motility and AKT-mediated chemoprotection, MERTK-10A cells did not form stable colonies in soft agar, or enhance proliferation compared with parental MCF10A cells. Concomitant to chemoresistance, MERTK also stimulated efferocytosis in a gain-of-function capacity. However, unlike AXL, MERTK activation was highly dependent on apoptotic cells, suggesting MERTK may preferentially interface with phosphatidylserine. Consistent with this idea, knockdown of MERTK in breast cancer cells MDA-MB 231 reduced efferocytosis, while transient or stable expression of MERTK stimulated apoptotic cell clearance in all cell lines tested. Moreover, human breast cancer cells with higher endogenous MERTK showed higher levels of efferocytosis that could be blocked by soluble TAM receptors. Finally, through MERTK, apoptotic cells induced PD-L1 expression, an immune checkpoint blockade, suggesting that cancer cells may adopt MERTK-driven efferocytosis as an immune suppression mechanism for their advantage. These data collectively identify MERTK as a significant link between cancer progression and efferocytosis, and a potentially unrealized tumor-promoting event when MERTK is overexpressed in epithelial cells.},

Some non-coding regions exhibited high mutation frequencies, but most have distinctive structural features probably causing elevated mutation rates and do not contain driver mutations. Mutational signature analysis was extended to genome rearrangements and revealed twelve base substitution and six rearrangement signatures. Three rearrangement signatures, characterized by tandem duplications or deletions, appear associated with defective homologous-recombination-based DNA repair: one with deficient BRCA1 function, another with deficient BRCA1 or BRCA2 function, the cause of the third is unknown.

These processes mark the genome, such that a cancer's life history is encrypted in the somatic mutations present. We developed algorithms to decipher this narrative and applied them to 21 breast cancers. Mutational processes evolve across a cancer's lifespan, with many emerging late but contributing extensive genetic variation. Subclonal diversification is prominent, and most mutations are found in just a fraction of tumor cells. Every tumor has a dominant subclonal lineage, representing more than 50\% of tumor cells. Minimal expansion of these subclones occurs until many hundreds to thousands of mutations have accumulated, implying the existence of long-lived, quiescent cell lineages capable of substantial proliferation upon acquisition of enabling genomic changes. Expansion of the dominant subclone to an appreciable mass may therefore represent the final rate-limiting step in a breast cancer's development, triggering diagnosis. PaperClip},

Conventional clustering/subtyping approaches often fail to define such subtypes, as they involve several discrete steps. Here we demonstrate a unique machine-learning method, phenotype mapping (PhenMap), which jointly integrates single omics data with phenotypic information using three published breast cancer datasets (n = 2045). The PhenMap framework uses a modified factor analysis method that is governed by a key assumption that, features from different omics data types are correlated due to specific "hidden/mapping" variables (context-specific mapping variables (CMV)). These variables can be simultaneously modeled with phenotypic data as covariates to yield functional subtypes and their associated features (e.g., genes) and phenotypes. In one example, we demonstrate the identification and validation of six novel "functional" (discrete) subtypes with differential responses to a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6 inhibitor and etoposide by jointly integrating transcriptome profiles with four different drug response data from 37 breast cancer cell lines. These robust subtypes are also present in patient breast tumors with different prognosis. In another example, we modeled patient gene expression profiles and clinical covariates together to identify continuous subtypes with clinical/biological implications. Overall, this genome-phenome machine-learning integration tool, PhenMap identifies functional and phenotype-integrated discrete or continuous subtypes with clinical translational potential.},

  abstract = {The GATA4 transcription factor acts as a master regulator of development of multiple tissues. GATA4 also acts in a distinct capacity to control a stress-inducible pro-inflammatory secretory program that is associated with senescence, a potent tumor suppression mechanism, but also operates in non-senescent contexts such as tumorigenesis. This secretory pathway is composed of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors, and proteases. Since GATA4 is deleted or epigenetically silenced in cancer, here we examine the role of GATA4 in tumorigenesis in mouse models through both loss-of-function and overexpression experiments. We find that GATA4 promotes non-cell autonomous tumor suppression in multiple model systems. Mechanistically, we show that Gata4-dependent tumor suppression requires cytotoxic CD8 T cells and partially requires the secreted chemokine CCL2. Analysis of transcriptome data in human tumors reveals reduced lymphocyte infiltration in GATA4-deficient tumors, consistent with our murine data. Notably, activation of the GATA4-dependent secretory program combined with an~anti-PD-1 antibody robustly abrogates tumor growth in vivo.},

Here we demonstrate the analytical development and validation of a custom NanoString nCounter platform-based biomarker assay (NanoCRCA) to stratify CRCs into subtypes. To reduce costs, we switched from the standard nCounter protocol to a custom modified protocol. The assay included a reduced 38-gene panel that was selected using an in-house machine-learning~pipeline. We applied NanoCRCA to 413 samples from 355 CRC patients. From the fresh frozen samples (n\,=\,237), a subset had matched microarray/RNAseq profiles (n\,=\,47) or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples (n\,=\,58). We also analyzed a further 118 FFPE samples. We compared the assay results with the CMS classifier, different platforms (microarrays/RNAseq) and gene-set classifiers (38 and the original 786 genes). The standard and modified protocols showed high correlation ({$>$}\,0.88) for gene expression. Technical replicates were highly correlated ({$>$}\,0.96). NanoCRCA classified fresh frozen and FFPE samples into all five CRCA subtypes with consistent classification of selected matched fresh frozen/FFPE samples. We demonstrate high and significant subtype concordance across protocols (100\%), gene sets (95\%), platforms (87\%) and with CMS subtypes (75\%) when evaluated across multiple datasets. Overall, our NanoCRCA assay with further validation may facilitate prospective validation of CRC subtypes in clinical trials and beyond.},

  abstract = {The rates and routes of lethal systemic spread in breast cancer are poorly understood owing to a lack of molecularly characterized patient cohorts with long-term, detailed follow-up data. Long-term follow-up is especially important for those with oestrogen-receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers, which can recur up to two decades after initial diagnosis1–6. It is therefore essential to identify patients who have a high risk of late relapse7–9. Here we present a statistical framework that models distinct disease stages (locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, breast-cancer-related death~and death from other causes) and competing risks of mortality from breast cancer, while yielding individual risk-of-recurrence predictions. We apply this model to 3,240 patients with breast cancer, including 1,980 for whom molecular data are available, and delineate spatiotemporal patterns of relapse across different categories of molecular information (namely immunohistochemical subtypes; PAM50 subtypes, which are based on gene-expression patterns10,11; and integrative or IntClust subtypes, which are based on patterns of genomic copy-number alterations and gene expression12,13). We identify four late-recurring integrative subtypes, comprising~about one quarter (26\%) of tumours that are both positive for ER and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, each with characteristic tumour-driving alterations in genomic copy number and a high risk of recurrence (mean 47–62\%) up to 20 years after diagnosis. We also define a subgroup of triple-negative breast cancers in which cancer rarely recurs after five years, and a separate subgroup in which patients remain at risk. Use of the integrative subtypes improves the prediction of late, distant relapse beyond what is possible with clinical covariates (nodal status, tumour size, tumour grade and immunohistochemical subtype). These findings highlight opportunities for improved patient stratification and biomarker-driven clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Background Breast cancer exhibits significant molecular, pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Current clinicopathological evaluation is imperfect for predicting outcome, which results in overtreatment for many patients, and for others, leads to death from recurrent disease. Therefore, additional criteria are needed to better personalize care and maximize treatment effectiveness and survival. Methods To address these challenges, the Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network - Breast (SCAN-B) consortium was initiated in 2010 as a multicenter prospective study with longsighted aims to analyze breast cancers with next-generation genomic technologies for translational research in a population-based manner and integrated with healthcare; decipher fundamental tumor biology from these analyses; utilize genomic data to develop and validate new clinically-actionable biomarker assays; and establish real-time clinical implementation of molecular diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive tests. In the first phase, we focus on molecular profiling by next-generation RNA-sequencing on the Illumina platform. Results In the first 3~years from 30 August 2010 through 31 August 2013, we have consented and enrolled 3,979 patients with primary breast cancer at the seven hospital sites in South Sweden, representing approximately 85\% of eligible patients in the catchment area. Preoperative blood samples have been collected for 3,942 (99\%) patients and primary tumor specimens collected for 2,929 (74\%) patients. Herein we describe the study infrastructure and protocols and present initial proof of concept results from prospective RNA sequencing including tumor molecular subtyping and detection of driver gene mutations. Prospective patient enrollment is ongoing. Conclusions We demonstrate that large-scale population-based collection and RNA-sequencing analysis of breast cancer is feasible. The SCAN-B Initiative should significantly reduce the time to discovery, validation, and clinical implementation of novel molecular diagnostic and predictive tests. We welcome the participation of additional comprehensive cancer treatment centers. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02306096.

  abstract = {The problem of segmenting linearly ordered data is frequently encountered in time-series analysis, computational biology, and natural language processing. Segmentations obtained independently from replicate data sets or from the same data with different methods or parameter settings pose the problem of computing an aggregate or consensus segmentation. This Segmentation Aggregation problem amounts to finding a segmentation that minimizes the sum of distances to the input segmentations. It is again a segmentation problem and can be solved by dynamic programming. The aim of this contribution is (1) to gain a better mathematical understanding of the Segmentation Aggregation problem and its solutions and (2) to demonstrate that consensus segmentations have useful applications. Extending previously known results we show that for a large class of distance functions only breakpoints present in at least one input segmentation appear in the consensus segmentation. Furthermore, we derive a bound on the size of consensus segments. As show-case applications, we investigate a yeast transcriptome and show that consensus segments provide a robust means of identifying transcriptomic units. This approach is particularly suited for dense transcriptomes with polycistronic transcripts, operons, or a lack of separation between transcripts. As a second application, we demonstrate that consensus segmentations can be used to robustly identify growth regimes from sets of replicate growth curves.},

Thus, it is of fundamental clinical importance to understand its molecular functions and determine whether ARID1A deficiency can be exploited therapeutically. In this article, we report a key function of ARID1A in regulating the DNA damage checkpoint. ARID1A is recruited to DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) via its interaction with the upstream DNA damage checkpoint kinase ATR. At the molecular level, ARID1A facilitates efficient processing of DSB to single-strand ends and sustains DNA damage signaling. Importantly, ARID1A deficiency sensitizes cancer cells to PARP inhibitors in vitro and in vivo, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for patients with ARID1A-mutant tumors.Significance:ARID1A has been identified as one of the most frequently mutated genes across human cancers. Our data suggest that clinical utility of PARP inhibitors might be extended beyond patients with BRCA mutations to a larger group of patients with ARID1A-mutant tumors, which may exhibit therapeutic vulnerability to PARP inhibitors.

Based on these features, therapeutic stratification for individual patients may be designed, which may ultimately lead to improved therapeutic outcomes. In this comprehensive review, we have attempted to briefly outline major CRC pathways. A detailed overview of molecular subtypes and their clinical significance has been discussed. Present and future methods, governing CRC subtyping in the era of personalized therapy with a special emphasis on CMS subtypes of CRC has been reviewed.

  abstract = {Background Colon cancer (CC) is a heterogeneous disease. Novel prognostic factors beyond pathological staging are required to accurately identify patients at higher risk of relapse. Integrating these new biological factors, such as plasma circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), CDX2 staining, inflammation-associated cytokines and transcriptomic consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) classification, into a multimodal approach may improve our accuracy in determining risk of recurrence. Methods One hundred and fifty patients consecutively diagnosed with localised CC were prospectively enrolled in our study. ctDNA was tracked to detect minimal residual disease by droplet digital PCR. CDX2 expression was analysed by immunostaining. Plasma levels of cytokines potentially involved in disease progression were measured using ELISAs. A 96 custom gene panel for nCounter assay was used to classify CC into colorectal cancer assigner and CMS. Results Most patients were classified into CMS4 (37\%) and CMS2 (28\%), followed by CMS1 (20\%) and CMS3 (15\%) groups. CDX2-negative tumours were enriched in CMS1 and CMS4 subtypes. In univariable analysis, prognosis was influenced by primary tumour location, stage, vascular and perineural invasion together with high interleukin-6 plasma levels at baseline, tumours belonging to CMS 1 vs CMS2 +CMS3, ctDNA presence in plasma and CDX2 loss. However, only positive ctDNA in plasma samples (HR 13.64; p=0.002) and lack of CDX2 expression (HR 23.12; p=0.001) were found to be independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival in the multivariable model. Conclusions ctDNA detection after surgery and lack of CDX2 expression identified patients at very high risk of recurrence in localised CC.},

  abstract = {Most human epithelial tumors harbor numerous alterations, making it difficult to predict which genes are required for tumor survival. To systematically identify cancer dependencies, we analyzed 501 genome-scale loss-of-function screens performed in diverse human cancer cell lines. We developed DEMETER, an analytical framework that segregates on- from off-target effects of RNAi. 769 genes were differentially required in subsets of these cell lines at a threshold of six SDs from the mean. We found predictive models for 426 dependencies (55\%) by nonlinear regression modeling considering 66,646 molecular features. Many dependencies fall into a limited number of classes, and unexpectedly, in 82\% of models, the top biomarkers were expression based. We demonstrated the basis behind one such~predictive model linking hypermethylation of the UBB ubiquitin gene to a dependency on UBC. Together, these observations provide a foundation for a cancer dependency map that facilitates the prioritization of therapeutic targets.},

We report on a living biobank of PDOs from metastatic, heavily pretreated colorectal and gastroesophageal cancer patients recruited in phase 1/2 clinical trials. Phenotypic and genotypic profiling of PDOs showed a high degree of similarity to the original patient tumors. Molecular profiling of tumor organoids was matched to drug-screening results, suggesting that PDOs could complement existing approaches in defining cancer vulnerabilities and improving treatment responses. We compared responses to anticancer agents ex vivo in organoids and PDO-based orthotopic mouse tumor xenograft models with the responses of the patients in clinical trials. Our data suggest that PDOs can recapitulate patient responses in the clinic and could be implemented in personalized medicine programs.},

  abstract = {Despite showing clinical activity in BRAF-mutant melanoma, the MEK inhibitor (MEKi) trametinib has failed to show clinical benefit in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer. To identify mechanisms of resistance to MEKi, we employed a pharmacogenomic analysis of MEKi-sensitive versus MEKi-resistant colorectal cancer cell lines. Strikingly, interferon- and inflammatory-related gene sets were enriched in cell lines exhibiting intrinsic and acquired resistance to MEK inhibition. The bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 suppressed interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression and in combination with MEK inhibitors displayed synergistic effects and induced apoptosis in MEKi-resistant colorectal cancer cell lines. ISG expression was confirmed in patient-derived organoid models, which displayed resistance to trametinib and were resensitized by JQ1 co-treatment. In in vivo models of colorectal cancer, combination treatment significantly suppressed tumor growth. Our findings provide a novel explanation for the limited response to MEK inhibitors in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer, known for its inflammatory nature. Moreover, the high expression of ISGs was associated with significantly reduced survival of colorectal cancer patients. Excitingly, we have identified novel therapeutic opportunities to overcome intrinsic and acquired resistance to MEK inhibition in colorectal cancer.},

  abstract = {DNA mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd) is associated with a high tumor mutational burden (TMB) and sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Nevertheless, most MMRd tumors do not durably respond to ICB and critical questions remain about immunosurveillance and TMB in these tumors. In the present study, we developed autochthonous mouse models of MMRd lung and colon cancer. Surprisingly, these models did not display increased T cell infiltration or ICB response, which we showed to be the result of substantial intratumor heterogeneity of mutations. Furthermore, we found that immunosurveillance shapes the clonal architecture but not the overall burden of neoantigens, and T cell responses against subclonal neoantigens are blunted. Finally, we showed that clonal, but not subclonal, neoantigen burden predicts ICB response in clinical trials of MMRd gastric and colorectal cancer. These results provide important context for understanding immune evasion in cancers with a high TMB and have major implications for therapies aimed at increasing TMB.},

We sequenced whole genomes or a panel of 365 genes on 299 samples from 170 patients with locally relapsed or metastatic breast cancer. Several lines of analysis indicate that clones seeding metastasis or relapse disseminate late from primary tumors, but continue to acquire mutations, mostly accessing the same mutational processes active in the primary tumor. Most distant metastases acquired driver mutations not seen in the primary tumor, drawing from a wider repertoire of cancer genes than early drivers. These include a number of clinically actionable alterations and mutations inactivating SWI-SNF and JAK2-STAT3 pathways.},

  abstract = {Anticancer drugs, such as camptothecin (CPT), trap topoisomerase I (TOP1) on DNA and form TOP1 cleavage complexes (TOP1cc). Alternative repair pathways have been suggested in the repair of TOP1cc. However, how these pathways work with TDP1, a key repair enzyme that specifically hydrolyze the covalent bond between TOP1 catalytic tyrosine and the 3’-end of DNA and contribute to the repair of TOP1cc is poorly understood. Here, using unbiased whole-genome CRISPR screens and generation of co-deficient cells with TDP1 and other genes, we demonstrate that MUS81 is an important factor that mediates the generation of excess double-strand breaks (DSBs) in TDP1 KO cells. APEX1/2 are synthetic lethal with TDP1. However, deficiency of APEX1/2 does not reduce DSB formation in TDP1 KO cells. Together, our data suggest that TOP1cc can be either resolved directly by TDP1 or be converted into DSBs and repaired further by the Homologous Recombination (HR) pathway.},
