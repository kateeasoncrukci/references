  abstract = {The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates the effects of the environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Recently, AHR has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer by virtue of its ability to modulate estrogen receptor-α (ERα) signalling and/or its ability to block cell proliferation. Our previous studies identified cyclin G2 (CCNG2), an inhibitor of cell-cycle progression, as an AHR target gene; however, the mechanism of this regulation is unknown. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in T-47D human breast cancer cells revealed a TCDD-dependent recruitment of AHR, nuclear co-activator 3 (NCoA3) and the transcription factor forkhead box A1 (FOXA1), a key regulator of breast cancer cell signaling, to CCNG2 resulting in increases in CCNG2 mRNA and protein levels. Mutation of the AHR response element (AHRE) and forkhead-binding sites abolished TCDD-induced CCNG2-regulated reporter gene activity. RNA interference–mediated knockdown of FOXA1 prevented the TCDD-dependent recruitment of AHR and NCoA3 to CCNG2 and reduced CCNG2 mRNA levels. Interestingly, knockdown of FOXA1 also caused a marked decrease in ERα, but not AHR protein levels. However, RNA interference–mediated knockdown of ERα, a negative regulator of CCNG2, had no effect on TCDD-dependent AHR or NCoA3 recruitment to or expression of CCNG2. These findings show that FOXA1, but not ERα, is essential for AHR-dependent regulation of CCNG2, assigning a role for FOXA1 in AHR action. Mol Cancer Res; 10(5); 636–48. ©2012 AACR.},

  abstract = {Cancer immunotherapy utilizing T-cell checkpoint inhibitors has shown tremendous clinical success. Yet, this mode of treatment is effective in only a subset of patients. Unresponsive patients tend to have non-T-cell-inflamed tumors that lack markers associated with the activation of adaptive anti-tumor immune responses. Notably, elimination of cancer cells by T cells is critically dependent on the optimal activity of innate immune cells. Therefore, identifying new targets that regulate innate immune cell function and promote the engagement of adaptive tumoricidal responses is likely to lead to the development of improved therapies against cancer. Here, we review the TAM receptor tyrosine kinases-TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK-as an emerging class of innate immune checkpoints that participate in key steps of anti-tumoral immunity. Namely, TAM-mediated efferocytosis, negative regulation of dendritic cell activity, and dysregulated production of chemokines collectively favor the escape of malignant cells. Hence, disabling TAM signaling may promote engagement of adaptive immunity and complement T-cell checkpoint blockade.},

This left truncation can be dealt with in non-parametric (Kaplan–Meier) and semi-parametric (Cox) time-to-event analyses, theoretically generating an unbiased hazard ratio (HR) when the proportional hazards (PH) assumption holds. However, concern remains that inclusion of prevalent cases in survival analysis results inevitably in HR bias. We used data on three well-established breast cancer prognosticators – clinical stage, histopathological grade and oestrogen receptor (ER) status – from the SEARCH study, a population-based study including 4470 invasive breast cancer cases (incident and prevalent), to evaluate empirically the effectiveness of allowing for left truncation in limiting HR bias. We found that HRs of prognostic factors changed over time and used extended Cox models incorporating time-dependent covariates. When comparing Cox models restricted to subjects ascertained within six months of diagnosis (incident cases) to models based on the full data set allowing for left truncation, we found no difference in parameter estimates (P=0.90, 0.32 and 0.95, for stage, grade and ER status respectively). Our results show that use of prevalent cases in an observational epidemiological study of breast cancer does not bias the HR in a left truncation Cox survival analysis, provided the PH assumption holds true.},

  abstract = {Expression of Snail1 in epithelial cells triggers an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we demonstrate that the synthesis of Zeb2, a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin, is up-regulated after Snail1-induced EMT. Snail1 does not affect the synthesis of Zeb2 mRNA, but prevents the processing of a large intron located in its 5′-untranslated region (UTR). This intron contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) necessary for the expression of Zeb2. Maintenance of 5′-UTR Zeb2 intron is dependent on the expression of a natural antisense transcript (NAT) that overlaps the 5′ splice site in the intron. Ectopic overexpression of this NAT in epithelial cells prevents splicing of the Zeb2 5′-UTR, increases the levels of Zeb2 protein, and consequently down-regulates E-cadherin mRNA and protein. The relevance of these results is demonstrated by the strong association between NAT presence and conservation of the 5′-UTR intron in cells that have undergone EMT or in human tumors with low E-cadherin expression. Therefore, the results presented in this article reveal the existence of a NAT capable of activating Zeb2 expression, explain the mechanism involved in this activation, and demonstrate that this NAT regulates E-cadherin expression.},

  abstract = {Various cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) complexes have been implicated in the regulation of transcription. In this study, we identified a 70-kDa Cyclin K (CycK) that binds Cdk12 and Cdk13 to form two different complexes (CycK/Cdk12 or CycK/Cdk13) in human cells. The CycK/Cdk12 complex regulates phosphorylation of Ser2 in the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and expression of a small subset of human genes, as revealed in expression microarrays. Depletion of CycK/Cdk12 results in decreased expression of predominantly long genes with high numbers of exons. The most prominent group of down-regulated genes are the DNA damage response genes, including the critical regulators of genomic stability: BRCA1 (breast and ovarian cancer type 1 susceptibility protein 1), ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related), FANCI, and FANCD2. We show that CycK/Cdk12, rather than CycK/Cdk13, is necessary for their expression. Nuclear run-on assays and chromatin immunoprecipitations with RNA polymerase II on the BRCA1 and FANCI genes suggest a transcriptional defect in the absence of CycK/Cdk12. Consistent with these findings, cells without CycK/Cdk12 induce spontaneous DNA damage and are sensitive to a variety of DNA damage agents. We conclude that through regulation of expression of DNA damage response genes, CycK/Cdk12 protects cells from genomic instability. The essential role of CycK for organisms in vivo is further supported by the result that genetic inactivation of CycK in mice causes early embryonic lethality.},

There were close to 20 million new cases of cancer in the year 2022 (including nonmelanoma skin cancers [NMSCs]) alongside 9.7 million deaths from cancer (including NMSC). The estimates suggest that approximately one in five men or women develop cancer in a lifetime, whereas around one in nine men and one in 12 women die from it. Lung cancer was the most frequently diagnosed cancer in 2022, responsible for almost 2.5 million new cases, or one in eight cancers worldwide (12.4\% of all cancers globally), followed by cancers of the female breast (11.6\%), colorectum (9.6\%), prostate (7.3\%), and stomach (4.9\%). Lung cancer was also the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18.7\%), followed by colorectal (9.3\%), liver (7.8\%), female breast (6.9\%), and stomach (6.8\%) cancers. Breast cancer and lung cancer were the most frequent cancers in women and men, respectively (both cases and deaths). Incidence rates (including NMSC) varied from four-fold to five-fold across world regions, from over 500 in Australia/New Zealand (507.9 per 100,000) to under 100 in Western Africa (97.1 per 100,000) among men, and from over 400 in Australia/New Zealand (410.5 per 100,000) to close to 100 in South-Central Asia (103.3 per 100,000) among women. The authors examine the geographic variability across 20 world regions for the 10 leading cancer types, discussing recent trends, the underlying determinants, and the prospects for global cancer prevention and control. With demographics-based predictions indicating that the number of new cases of cancer will reach 35 million by 2050, investments in prevention, including the targeting of key risk factors for cancer (including smoking, overweight and obesity, and infection), could avert millions of future cancer diagnoses and save many lives worldwide, bringing huge economic as well as societal dividends to countries over the forthcoming decades.},

Runx1 is functionally promiscuous and acts as either an oncogene or tumor suppressor gene in certain epithelial cancers. Recent evidence suggests that Runx1 is an important factor in breast cancer, however its role remains ambiguous. Here, we addressed whether Runx1 has a specific pathological role during breast cancer progression and show that Runx1 has an oncogenic function. We observed elevated Runx1 expression in a subset of human breast cancers. Furthermore, throughout the course of disease progression in a classical mouse model of breast cancer (i.e., the MMTV-PyMT transgenic model), Runx1 expression increases in the primary site (mammary gland) and is further upregulated in tumors and distal lung metastatic lesions. Ex vivo studies using tumor epithelial cells derived from these mice express significantly higher levels of Runx1 than normal mammary epithelial cells. The tumor cells exhibit increased rates of migration and invasion, indicative of an aggressive cancer phenotype. Inhibition of Runx1 expression using RNA interference significantly abrogates these cancer-relevant phenotypic characteristics. Importantly, our data establish that Runx1 contributes to murine mammary tumor development and malignancy and potentially represents a key disease-promoting and prognostic factor in human breast cancer progression and metastasis.},

There is evidence that loss of function of two of the three mammalian Runx genes promotes cancer, but in a highly lineage-restricted manner. In human leukemias, the RUNX1 gene is involved in various chromosomal translocation events that create oncogenic fusion proteins, at least some of which appear to function as dominant-negative inhibitors of the normal gene product. Paradoxically, evidence is mounting that structurally intact Runx genes are also oncogenic when overexpressed. All the three murine genes act as targets for transcriptional activation by retroviral insertional mutagenesis, and the oncogenic potential of Runx2 has been confirmed in transgenic mice. Moreover, the RUNX1 gene is often amplified or overexpressed in cases of acute leukemia. The state of progress in elucidating the oncogenic roles of the Runx genes is the subject of this review, and we draw together recent observations in a tentative model for the effects of Runx deregulation on hematopoietic cell differentiation. We suggest that lineage-specific factors determine the sensitivity to the oncogenic effects of loss or overexpression of Runx factors.},

  abstract = {Most cancer genomic data are generated from bulk samples composed of mixtures of cancer subpopulations, as well as normal cells. Subclonal reconstruction methods based on machine learning aim to separate those subpopulations in a sample and infer their evolutionary history. However, current approaches are entirely data driven and agnostic to evolutionary theory. We demonstrate that systematic errors occur in the analysis if evolution is not accounted for, and this is exacerbated with multi-sampling of the same tumor. We present a novel approach for model-based tumor subclonal reconstruction, called MOBSTER, which combines machine learning with theoretical population genetics. Using public whole-genome sequencing data from 2,606 samples from different cohorts, new data and synthetic validation, we show that this method is more robust and accurate than current techniques in single-sample, multiregion and longitudinal data. This approach minimizes the confounding factors of nonevolutionary methods, thus leading to more accurate recovery of the evolutionary history of human cancers.},

We report that VCAM-1 provides a survival advantage to breast cancer cells that infiltrate leukocyte-rich microenvironments such as the lungs. VCAM-1 tethers metastasis-associated macrophages to cancer cells via counter-receptor α4-integrins. Clustering of cell surface VCAM-1, acting through Ezrin, triggers Akt activation and protects cancer cells from proapoptotic cytokines such as TRAIL. This prosurvival function of VCAM-1 can be blocked by antibodies against α4-integrins. Thus, newly disseminated cancer cells expressing VCAM-1 can thrive in leukocyte-rich microenvironments through juxtacrine activation of a VCAM-1–Ezrin-PI3K/Akt survival pathway.},

However, mechanisms underlying the implied RUNX1-mediated tumour suppression remain elusive. Here, by depleting mammary epithelial cells of RUNX1 in vivo and in vitro, we demonstrate combinatorial regulation of AXIN1 by RUNX1 and oestrogen. RUNX1 and ER occupy adjacent elements in AXIN1’s second intron, and RUNX1 antagonizes oestrogen-mediated AXIN1 suppression. Accordingly, RNA-seq and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrate an ER-dependent correlation between RUNX1 and AXIN1 in tumour biopsies. RUNX1 loss in ER+ mammary epithelial cells increases β-catenin, deregulates mitosis and stimulates cell proliferation and expression of stem cell markers. However, it does not stimulate LEF/TCF, c-Myc or CCND1, and it does not accelerate G1/S cell cycle phase transition. Finally, RUNX1 loss-mediated deregulation of β-catenin and mitosis is ameliorated by AXIN1 stabilization in vitro, highlighting AXIN1 as a potential target for the management of ER+ breast cancer.},

Using breast cancer cell lines as a model system, we sought to discover gene expression signatures of EMT with clinical and mechanistic relevance. A supervised comparison of epithelial and mesenchymal breast cancer lines defined a 200-gene EMT signature that was prognostic across multiple breast cancer cohorts. The immunostaining of LYN, a top-ranked EMT signature gene and Src-family tyrosine kinase, was associated with significantly shorter overall survival (P = 0.02) and correlated with the basal-like ("triple-negative") phenotype. In mesenchymal breast cancer lines, RNAi-mediated knockdown of LYN inhibited cell migration and invasion, but not proliferation. Dasatinib, a dual-specificity tyrosine kinase inhibitor, also blocked invasion (but not proliferation) at nanomolar concentrations that inhibit LYN kinase activity, suggesting that LYN is a likely target and that invasion is a relevant end point for dasatinib therapy. Our findings define a prognostically relevant EMT signature in breast cancer and identify LYN as a mediator of invasion and a possible new therapeutic target (and theranostic marker for dasatinib response), with particular relevance to clinically aggressive basal-like breast cancer.},

In the presence of HNF3, GATA-4 binds stably to an HNF3-positioned nucleosome. Histone acetylation does not affect HNF3 binding. This is evidence for stable nucleosome binding by a transcription factor and shows that a winged helix protein is sufficient to initiate the assembly of an enhancer complex on nonacetylated nucleosomes.},

  abstract = {Purpose Predicting the pattern of recurrence can aid in the development of targeted surveillance and treatment strategies. We identified patient populations that remain at risk for an event at a median follow-up of 24 years from the diagnosis of operable breast cancer. Patients and Methods International Breast Cancer Study Group clinical trials I to V randomly assigned 4,105 patients between 1978 and 1985. Annualized hazards were estimated for breast cancer–free interval (primary end point), disease-free survival, and overall survival. Results For the entire group, the annualized hazard of recurrence was highest during the first 5 years (10.4\%), with a peak between years 1 and 2 (15.2\%). During the first 5 years, patients with estrogen receptor (ER) – positive disease had a lower annualized hazard compared with those with ER-negative disease (9.9\% v 11.5\%; P = .01). However, beyond 5 years, patients with ER-positive disease had higher hazards (5 to 10 years: 5.4\% v 3.3\%; 10 to 15 years: 2.9\% v 1.3\%; 15 to 20 years: 2.8\% v 1.2\%; and 20 to 25 years: 1.3\% v 1.4\%; P {$<$} .001). Among patients with ER-positive disease, annualized hazards of recurrence remained elevated and fairly stable beyond 10 years, even for those with no axillary involvement (2.0\%, 2.1\%, and 1.1\% for years 10 to 15, 15 to 20, and 20 to 25, respectively) and for those with one to three positive nodes (3.0\%, 3.5\%, and 1.5\%, respectively). Conclusion Patients with ER-positive breast cancer maintain a significant recurrence rate during extended follow up. Strategies for follow up and treatments to prevent recurrences may be most efficiently applied and studied in patients with ER-positive disease followed for a long period of time.},

SIP1 and Snail bind to partly overlapping promoter sequences and showed similar silencing effects. SIP1 can be induced by TGF-β treatment and shows high expression in several E-cadherin-negative human carcinoma cell lines. Conditional expression of SIP1 in E-cadherin-positive MDCK cells abrogates E-cadherin-mediated intercellular adhesion and simultaneously induces invasion. SIP1 therefore appears to be a promoter of invasion in malignant epithelial tumors.},

We find that chromothripsis events are pervasive across cancers, with a frequency of more than 50\% in several cancer types. Whereas canonical chromothripsis profiles display oscillations between two copy-number states, a considerable fraction of events involve multiple chromosomes and additional structural alterations. In addition to non-homologous end joining, we detect signatures of replication-associated processes and templated insertions. Chromothripsis contributes to oncogene amplification and to inactivation of genes such as mismatch-repair-related genes.

  abstract = {Objective Primary tumour location is regarded as a reliable surrogate of colorectal cancer biology. Sensitivity to anti-EGFRs (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) of metastatic transverse colon cancers (mTCCs) has usually been assumed similar to right-sided tumours; however, evidence about the clinical behaviour of mTCC is limited. Thus, to verify sensitivity of mTCC to anti-EGFRs we conducted the present study. Methods Patients with RAS/BRAF wild-type microsatellite stable (MSS) mTCC receiving anti-EGFR monotherapy, or in combination with irinotecan if clearly irinotecan-refractory, were included. Hypothesising an overall response rate (ORR) of 35\%, 11 patients, of whom at least 3 were responders, were necessary to be able to reject the null hypothesis of an ORR of 5\%, with α and β errors of 0.05 and 0.20. PRESSING panel and consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) were assessed on tumour samples, whereas in-silico data were obtained from TCGA dataset. Results Among nine eligible patients, four and three achieved response and disease stabilisation (ORR 44\%). At a median follow-up of 23.1 months, median progression-free survival and overall survival were 7.3 (95\% CI 3.9 to NA) and 15.0 months (95\% CI 10.0 to NA), respectively. A MET amplification and an ERBB4 S303F substitution were detected in patients with rapid disease progression, while others had PRESSING panel-negative tumours with CMS2 or CMS4 subtypes. Conclusions RAS/BRAF wild-type MSS mTCCs may be sensitive to anti-EGFRs, as confirmed by molecular analyses.},

  abstract = {The elucidation of breast cancer subgroups and their molecular drivers requires integrated views of the genome and transcriptome from representative numbers of patients. We present an integrated analysis of copy number and gene expression in a discovery and validation set of 997 and 995 primary breast tumours, respectively, with long-term clinical follow-up. Inherited variants (copy number variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms) and acquired somatic copy number aberrations (CNAs) were associated with expression in ∼40\% of genes, with the landscape dominated by cis- and trans-acting CNAs. By delineating expression outlier genes driven in cis by CNAs, we identified putative cancer genes, including deletions in PPP2R2A, MTAP and MAP2K4. Unsupervised analysis of paired DNA–RNA profiles revealed novel subgroups with distinct clinical outcomes, which reproduced in the validation cohort. These include a high-risk, oestrogen-receptor-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a favourable prognosis subgroup devoid of CNAs. Trans-acting aberration hotspots were found to modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including a TCR deletion-mediated adaptive immune response in the ‘CNA-devoid’ subgroup and a basal-specific chromosome 5 deletion-associated mitotic network. Our results provide a novel molecular stratification of the breast cancer population, derived from the impact of somatic CNAs on the transcriptome.},

The ribosomal proteins L5, L11, and L23 can block this loop by inhibiting MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation in response to ribosomal stress. Here, we show that L11, but not L5 and L23, leads to a drastic accumulation of ubiquitinated and native MDM2. This effect is dependent on the ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2, but not p53, and requires the central MDM2 binding domain (residues 51-108) of L11. We further show that L11 inhibited 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation of ubiquitinated MDM2 in vitro and consistently prolonged the half-life of MDM2 in cells. These results suggest that L11, unlike L5 and L23, differentially regulates the levels of ubiquitinated p53 and MDM2 and inhibits the turnover and activity of MDM2 through a post-ubiquitination mechanism.},

  abstract = {Human tumors are believed to harbor a disabled p53 tumor suppressor pathway, either through direct mutation of the p53 gene or through aberrant expression of proteins acting in the p53 pathway, such as p14ARF or Mdm2. A role for Mdmx (or Mdm4) as a key negative regulator of p53 function in vivo has been established. However, a direct contribution of Mdmx to tumor formation remains to be demonstrated. Here we show that retrovirus-mediated Mdmx overexpression allows primary mouse embryonic fibroblast immortalization and leads to neoplastic transformation in combination with HRasV12. Furthermore, the human Mdmx ortholog, Hdmx, was found to be overexpressed in a significant percentage of various human tumors and amplified in 5\% of primary breast tumors, all of which retained wild-type p53. Hdmx was also amplified and highly expressed in MCF-7, a breast cancer cell line harboring wild-type p53, and interfering RNA-mediated reduction of Hdmx markedly inhibited the growth potential of these cells in a p53-dependent manner. Together, these results make Hdmx a new putative drug target for cancer therapy.},

Our results underline the importance of ITH and its drivers in tumor evolution and provide a pan-cancer resource of comprehensively annotated subclonal events from whole-genome sequencing data.},

  abstract = {Background Based on its mechanism of action, PARP inhibitor therapy is expected to benefit mainly tumor cases with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). Therefore, identification of tumor types with increased HRD is important for the optimal use of this class of therapeutic agents. HRD levels can be estimated using various mutational signatures from next generation sequencing data and we used this approach to determine whether breast cancer brain metastases show altered levels of HRD scores relative to their corresponding primary tumor. Patients and methods We used a previously published next generation sequencing dataset of 21 matched primary breast cancer/brain metastasis pairs to derive the various mutational signatures/HRD scores strongly associated with HRD. We also carried out the myChoice HRD analysis on an independent cohort of 17 breast cancer patients with matched primary/brain metastasis pairs. Results All of the mutational signatures indicative of HRD showed a significant increase in the brain metastases relative to their matched primary tumor in the previously published whole exome sequencing dataset. In the independent validation cohort, the myChoice HRD assay showed an increased level in 87.5\% of the brain metastases relative to the primary tumor, with 56\% of brain metastases being HRD positive according to the myChoice criteria. Conclusions The consistent observation that brain metastases of breast cancer tend to have higher HRD measures may raise the possibility that brain metastases may be more sensitive to PARP inhibitor treatment. This observation warrants further investigation to assess whether this increase is common to other metastatic sites as well, and whether clinical trials should adjust their strategy in the application of HRD measures for the prioritization of patients for PARP inhibitor therapy.},

Skeletal progenitors give rise to multiple tissues during development and during regenerative processes of bone, requiring postnatal endochondral and intramembranous ossification. The relevance of LGRs and the LGR/R spondin ligand interaction in bone and tooth biology is becoming increasingly appreciated. LGRs may define specific stem cell and progenitor populations and their behavior during both development and regeneration, and their role as Wnt associated receptors with specific ligands poses these proteins as unique therapeutic targets via potential R spondin agonism.

  abstract = {The NETO2 gene (neuropilin and tolloid-like 2) encodes a protein that acts as an accessory subunit of kainate receptors and is predominantly expressed in the brain. Upregulation of NETO2 has been observed in several tumors; however, its role in tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated NETO2 expression in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer using quantitative PCR (qPCR), as well as the effect of shRNA-mediated NETO2 silencing on transcriptome changes in colorectal cancer cells. In the investigated tumors, we observed both increased and decreased NETO2 mRNA levels, presenting no correlation with the main clinicopathological characteristics. In HCT116 cells, NETO2 knockdown resulted in the differential expression of 17 genes and 2 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), associated with the upregulation of circadian rhythm and downregulation of several cancer-associated pathways, including Wnt, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrated the possibility to utilize a novel model organism, short-lived fish Nothobranchius furzeri, for evaluating NETO2 functions. The ortholog neto2b in N. furzeri demonstrated a high similarity in nucleotide and amino acid sequences with human NETO2, as well as was characterized by stable expression in various fish tissues. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the deregulation of NETO2 in the breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer and its participation in the tumor development primarily through cellular signaling.},

  abstract = {The Colorectal Cancer Subtyping Consortium identified four gene expression consensus molecular subtypes, CMS1 (immune), CMS2 (canonical), CMS3 (metabolic), and CMS4 (mesenchymal), using multiple microarray or RNA-sequencing datasets of primary tumor samples mainly from early stage colon cancer patients. Consequently, rectal tumors and stage IV tumors (possibly reflective of more aggressive disease) were underrepresented, and no chemo- and/or radiotherapy pretreated samples or metastatic lesions were included. In view of their possible effect on gene expression and consequently subtype classification, sample source and treatments received by the patients before collection must be carefully considered when applying the classifier to new datasets. Recently, several correlative analyses of clinical trials demonstrated the applicability of this classification to the metastatic setting, confirmed the prognostic value of CMS subtypes after relapse and hinted at differential sensitivity to treatments. Here, we discuss why contexts and equivocal factors need to be taken into account when analyzing clinical trial data, including potential selection biases, type of platform, and type of algorithm used for subtype prediction. This perspective article facilitates both our clinical and research understanding of the application of this classifier to expedite subtype-based clinical trials.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Metastatic colorectal cancers (mCRCs) assigned to the transit-amplifying (TA) CRCAssigner subtype are more sensitive to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy. We evaluated the association between the intratumoral presence of TA signature (TA-high/TA-low, dubbed as TA-ness classification) and outcomes in CRCs treated with anti-EGFR therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The TA-ness classes were defined in a discovery cohort (n = 84) and independently validated in a clinical trial (CO.20; cetuximab monotherapy arm; n = 121) and other samples using an established NanoString-based gene expression assay. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and disease control rate (DCR) according to TA-ness classification were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The TA-ness was measured in 772 samples from 712 patients. Patients (treated with anti-EGFR therapy) with TA-high tumors had significantly longer PFS (discovery hazard ratio [HR], 0.40; 95\% CI, 0.25 to 0.64; P {$<$} .001; validation HR, 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.45 to 0.93; P = .018), longer OS (discovery HR, 0.48; 95\% CI, 0.29 to 0.78; P = .003; validation HR, 0.67; 95\% CI, 0.46 to 0.98; P = .04), and higher DCR (discovery odds ratio [OR]; 14.8; 95\% CI, 4.30 to 59.54; P {$<$} .001; validation OR, 4.35; 95\% CI, 2.00 to 9.09; P {$<$} .001). TA-ness classification and its association with anti-EGFR therapy outcomes were further confirmed using publicly available data (n = 80) from metastatic samples (PFS P {$<$} .001) and patient-derived xenografts (P = .042). In an exploratory analysis of 55 patients with RAS/BRAF wild-type and left-sided tumors, TA-high class was significantly associated with longer PFS and trend toward higher response rate (PFS HR, 0.53; 95\% CI, 0.28 to 1.00; P = .049; OR, 5.88; 95\% CI, 0.71 to 4.55; P = .09; response rate 33\% in TA-high and 7.7\% in TA-low). CONCLUSION: TA-ness classification is associated with prognosis in patients with mCRC treated with anti-EGFR therapy and may further help understanding the value of sidedness in patients with RAS/BRAF wild-type tumors.},

  abstract = {Although surgery for early-stage colorectal cancer (CRC) is often curative, many patients require adjuvant chemotherapy to treat micrometastatic disease and to reduce the risk of recurrence. Targeted therapies have improved outcomes for patients with metastatic disease but, in the adjuvant setting, options are limited to a fluoropyrimidine alone or in combination with oxaliplatin. There is an unmet need for new predictive biomarkers to personalise treatment in the adjuvant setting. With goals to address this gap and to better characterise disease heterogeneity, several groups including our own have identified three to six gene expression subtypes that were later consolidated into consensus molecular subtypes as part of the Colorectal Cancer Subtyping Consortium (CRCSC) effort. In this review, we discuss the differences and similarities between these subtypes and their potential prognostic and predictive values. We question whether a personalised treatment approach based on CRC subtypes might be beneficial in the adjuvant setting to improve treatment options and ultimately patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Recent functional and proteomic studies in eukaryotes (www.openprot.org) predict the translation of alternative open reading frames (AltORFs) in mature G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) mRNAs, including that of bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R). Our main objective was to determine the implication of a newly discovered AltORF resulting protein, termed AltB2R, in the known signaling properties of B2R using complementary methodological approaches. When ectopically expressed in HeLa cells, AltB2R presented predominant punctate cytoplasmic/perinuclear distribution and apparent cointeraction with B2R at plasma and endosomal/vesicular membranes. The presence of AltB2R increases intracellular [Ca2+] and ERK1/2-MAPK activation (via phosphorylation) following B2R stimulation. Moreover, HEK293A~cells expressing mutant B2R lacking concomitant expression of AltB2R displayed significantly decreased maximal responses in agonist-stimulated Gαq-Gαi2/3–protein coupling, IP3 generation, and ERK1/2-MAPK activation as compared with wild-type controls. Conversely, there was no difference in cell-surface density as well as ligand-binding properties of B2R and in efficiencies of cognate agonists at promoting B2R internalization and β-arrestin 2 recruitment. Importantly, both AltB2R and B2R proteins were overexpressed in prostate and breast cancers, compared with their normal counterparts suggesting new associative roles of AltB2R in these diseases. Our study shows that BDKRB2 is a dual-coding gene and identifies AltB2R as a novel positive modulator of some B2R signaling pathways. More broadly, it also supports a new, unexpected alternative proteome for GPCRs, which opens new frontiers in fields of GPCR biology, diseases, and drug discovery.},

  abstract = {The small GTPase Rac1 regulates many cellular processes, including cytoskeletal reorganization, cell migration, proliferation, and survival. Additionally, Rac1 plays a major role in activating NF-κB-mediated transcription. Both Rac1 and NF-κB regulate many properties of the malignant phenotype, including anchorage-independent proliferation and survival, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Despite these findings, the roles of Rac1and NF-κB in non-small cell lung carcinoma, a leading cause of cancer deaths, have not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we compared the effects of Rac1 siRNA to that of the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 on multiple features of the NSCLC malignant phenotype, including NF-κB activity. We show that the siRNA-mediated silencing of Rac1 in lung cancer cells results in decreased cell proliferation and migration. The decrease in proliferation was observed in both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent assays. Furthermore, cells with decreased Rac1 expression have a slowed progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. These effects induced by Rac1 siRNA correlated with a decrease in NF-κB transcriptional activity. Additionally, inhibition of NF-κB signaling with BAY 11–7082 inhibited proliferation; indicating that the loss of cell proliferation and migration induced by the silencing of Rac1 expression may be attributed in part to loss of NF-κB activity. Interestingly, treatment with the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 strongly inhibits cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and NF-κB activity in lung cancer cells, to an even greater extent than the inhibition induced by Rac1 siRNA. These findings indicate that Rac1 plays an important role in lung cancer cell proliferation and migration, most likely through its ability to promote NF-κB activity, and highlight Rac1 pathways as therapeutic targets for the treatment of lung cancer.},

Sequencing data from a single biopsy represent a snapshot of this process that can reveal the timing of specific genomic aberrations and the changing influence of mutational processes3. Here, by whole-genome sequencing analysis of 2,658 cancers as part of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium~of the~International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)4, we reconstruct the life history and evolution of mutational processes and driver mutation sequences of 38 types of cancer. Early oncogenesis is characterized by mutations in a constrained set of driver genes, and specific copy number gains, such as trisomy 7 in glioblastoma and isochromosome 17q in medulloblastoma. The mutational spectrum changes significantly throughout tumour evolution in 40\% of samples. A nearly fourfold diversification of driver genes and increased genomic instability are features of later stages. Copy number alterations often occur in mitotic crises, and lead to simultaneous gains of chromosomal segments. Timing analyses suggest that driver mutations often precede diagnosis by many years, if not decades. Together, these results determine the evolutionary trajectories of cancer, and highlight opportunities for early cancer detection.},

Here, we describe ReDACT (Restoring Disomy in Aneuploid cells using CRISPR Targeting), a set of chromosome engineering tools that allow us to eliminate specific aneuploidies from cancer genomes. Using ReDACT, we created a panel of isogenic cells that have or lack common aneuploidies, and we demonstrate that trisomy of chromosome 1q is required for malignant growth in cancers harboring this alteration. Mechanistically, gaining chromosome 1q increases the expression of MDM4 and suppresses p53 signaling, and we show that TP53 mutations are mutually exclusive with 1q aneuploidy in human cancers. Thus, tumor cells can be dependent on specific aneuploidies, raising the possibility that these “aneuploidy addictions” could be targeted as a therapeutic strategy.},

  abstract = {There are increasing reports of aberrant expression of GATA4, correlated with oncogenesis and malignant progression in some solid tumors, but whether GATA4 functions as an oncogenic driver or a tumor suppressor in carcinogenesis remains controversial. Because the role and mechanism of GATA4 in breast cancer (BrCa) remain poorly understood, we focused on the expression of GATA4 in BrCa cell lines and tissues and its mechanism in breast oncogenesis. Semiquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect expression of GATA4 in BrCa cell lines and adjacent breast tissues. Methylation statuses of the GATA4 promoter were studied using methylation-specific PCR in BrCa cell lines.The effects of GATA4 on proliferation, invasion, and cell cycle were also analyzed. Compared with adjacent breast tissue, GATA4 expression in BrCa tissue and cell lines was obviously lower and low expression levels of GATA4 predicted poor outcome. Methylation of GATA4 occurred in almost all of BrCa cell lines . GATA4 overexpression decreased viability, invasion, migration, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of MB-231 and BT549 cells, and markedly induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Exogenous expression GATA4 accompanied a significant alteration of MMP2, MMP3, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin expression and induction of the caspase-8 pathway. Moreover, GATA4 could directly repress RelA (p65) transcription, reduce the nuclear phosphorylation-p65 and upregulate inhibitor kappa B expression. Altogether, GATA4 plays a tumor-suppressive role via repression of NF-κB signaling in BrCa cells. Our findings suggest that GATA4 is a potential prognostic biomarker and gene therapeutic target for human BrCa.},

Treatment strategies differ according to molecular subtype. Management of breast cancer is multidisciplinary; it includes locoregional (surgery and radiation therapy) and systemic therapy approaches. Systemic therapies include endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive disease, chemotherapy, anti-HER2 therapy for HER2-positive disease, bone stabilizing agents, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for BRCA mutation carriers and, quite recently, immunotherapy. Future therapeutic concepts in breast cancer aim at individualization of therapy as well as at treatment de-escalation and escalation based on tumour biology and early therapy response. Next to further treatment innovations, equal worldwide access to therapeutic advances remains the global challenge in breast cancer care for the future.},

Here, we conduct automated histology image and spatial statistical analyses in 514 high grade serous ovarian samples to define cancer morphological diversification within the spatial context of the microenvironment. Tumor spatial zones, where cancer cell nuclei diversify in shape, are mapped in each tumor. Integration of this spatially explicit analysis with omics and clinical data reveals a relationship between morphological diversification and the dysregulation of DNA repair, loss of nuclear integrity, and increased disease mortality. Within the Immunoreactive subtype, spatial analysis further reveals significantly lower lymphocytic infiltration within diversified zones compared with other tumor zones, suggesting that even immune-hot tumors contain cells capable of immune escape. Our findings support a model whereby a subpopulation of morphologically plastic cancer cells with dysregulated DNA repair promotes ovarian cancer progression through positive selection by immune evasion.},

Neuropilin and tolloid-like 2 (NETO2), a member of the subfamily of CUB domain and LDLa-containing proteins, has been suggested to be involved in tumor progression. Nevertheless, little is known about the function and molecular mechanism of NETO2 in NPC progression. In the study, NETO2 was found to be significantly up-regulated in clinical tissues and NPC cell lines. NETO2 expression was positively correlated with tumor size. NETO2 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in NPC cell lines. Significantly, NETO2 knockdown promoted the radiotherapy in~vitro, as evidenced by the further reduced cell proliferation and metastasis in NPC cells using 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), colony formation and transwell analysis. In addition, NETO2 inhibition markedly induced apoptosis in NPC cells through activating Caspase-3 signaling. Also, the knockdown of NETO2 obviously promoted the efficacy of radiotherapy in apoptosis induction, along with higher expression of cleaved Caspase-3. NETO2 knockdown-triggered apoptosis in NPC cells were considerably diminished by Caspase-3 inactivation, demonstrating the essential role of Caspase-3 in NETO2-regulated NPC development. Moreover, in~vivo experiments suggested that NETO2 knockdown promoted radiation-induced tumor growth suppression in the absence of significant side effects. Collectively, reducing NETO2 expression might elevate the efficiency of radiotherapy in NPC patients.},

  abstract = {The molecular mechanisms that control the proliferation and differentiation of specific cell types remain poorly understood. Positive ETS factors play important roles in mediating proliferative responses to Ras/MAPK signaling in many cell types following mitogenic stimulation. PE-1/METS, a member of the ETS-domain family transcription factors that functions as a transcriptional repressor, can block mitogenic responses mediated by positively acting Ets factors. The anti-proliferative functions of PE-1/METS require its interaction with DP103, a multifunctional DEAD-box protein that mediates interactions with corepressor proteins and acts in a cooperative manner with Rb family members and to repress cell cycle control genes. ETS-2 repressor factor (ERF) is structurally related to and also functions as a transcriptional repressor, but endogenous target genes and mechanisms of repression remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that like PE-1/METS, ERF-mediated repression also requires DP103, and that ERF negatively regulates the c-myc and cdc2 genes. In contrast to PE-1/METS, however, ERF-mediated repression of these genes is inactivated by MAPK signaling through phosphorylation sites that are ERF-specific. Furthermore, constitutive activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway in RAW 264.7 cells transformed by the v-Abelson leukemia virus is associated with constitutive inactivation of ERF in this cell type. We propose that ERF and PE-1/METS function to impose 'repression checkpoints' on a subset of cell cycle control genes that are differentially regulated by growth factor signaling pathways that control proliferation and differentiation and that ERF is targeted for inactivation by transforming oncogenes such as vAbl.},

  abstract = {To identify therapeutic targets and prognostic markers for basal breast cancers, breast cancer cell lines were subjected to mass spectrometry–based profiling of protein tyrosine phosphorylation events. This revealed that luminal and basal breast cancer cells exhibit distinct tyrosine phosphorylation signatures that depend on pathway activation as well as protein expression. Basal breast cancer cells are characterized by elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of Met, Lyn, EphA2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and FAK, and Src family kinase (SFK) substrates such as p130Cas. SFKs exert a prominent role in these cells, phosphorylating key regulators of adhesion and migration and promoting tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR and Met. Consistent with these observations, SFK inhibition attenuated cellular proliferation, survival, and motility. Basal breast cancer cell lines exhibited differential responsiveness to small molecule inhibitors of EGFR and Met that correlated with the degree of target phosphorylation, and reflecting kinase coactivation, inhibiting two types of activated network kinase (e.g., EGFR and SFKs) was more effective than single agent approaches. FAK signaling enhanced both proliferation and invasion, and Lyn was identified as a proinvasive component of the network that is associated with a basal phenotype and poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. These studies highlight multiple kinases and substrates for further evaluation as therapeutic targets and biomarkers. However, they also indicate that patient stratification based on expression/activation of drug targets, coupled with use of multi-kinase inhibitors or combination therapies, may be required for effective treatment of this breast cancer subgroup.

CDK2 specifically phosphorylated FOXO1 at serine-249 (Ser249) in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylation of Ser249 resulted in cytoplasmic localization and inhibition of FOXO1. This phosphorylation was abrogated upon DNA damage through the cell cycle checkpoint pathway that is dependent on the protein kinases Chk1 and Chk2. Moreover, silencing of FOXO1 by small interfering RNA diminished DNA damage-induced death in both p53-deficient and p53-proficient cells. This effect was reversed by restored expression of FOXO1 in a manner depending on phosphorylation of Ser249. Functional interaction between CDK2 and FOXO1 provides a mechanism that regulates apoptotic cell death after DNA strand breakage.},

The reassembly of fragmented chromosomes by error-prone DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair generates a spectrum of simple and complex genomic rearrangements that are associated with human cancers and disorders. How specific DSB repair pathways recognize and process these lesions remains poorly understood. Here we used CRISPR/Cas9 to systematically inactivate distinct DSB processing or repair pathways and interrogated the rearrangement landscape of fragmented chromosomes from micronuclei. Deletion of canonical non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) components, including DNA-PKcs, LIG4, and XLF, substantially reduced the formation of complex rearrangements and shifted the rearrangement landscape toward simple alterations without the characteristic patterns of cancer-associated chromothripsis. Following reincorporation into the nucleus, fragmented chromosomes localize within micronuclei bodies (MN bodies) and undergo successful ligation by NHEJ within a single cell cycle. In the absence of NHEJ, chromosome fragments were rarely engaged by polymerase theta-mediated alternative end-joining or recombination-based mechanisms, resulting in delayed repair kinetics and persistent 53BP1-labeled MN bodies in the interphase nucleus. Prolonged DNA damage signaling from unrepaired fragments ultimately triggered cell cycle arrest. Thus, we provide evidence supporting NHEJ as the exclusive DSB repair pathway generating complex rearrangements following chromothripsis from mitotic errors.},

Nrf2 can protect cells and tissues from a variety of toxicants and carcinogens by increasing the expression of a number of cytoprotective genes. As a result, several Nrf2 activators are currently being tested as chemopreventive compounds in clinical trials. Just as Nrf2 protects normal cells, studies have shown that Nrf2 may also protect cancer cells from chemotherapeutic agents and facilitate cancer progression. Nrf2 is aberrantly accumulated in many types of cancer, and its expression is associated with a poor prognosis in patients. In addition, Nrf2 expression is induced during the course of drug resistance. Collectively, these studies suggest that Nrf2 contributes to both intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance. This discovery has opened up a broad spectrum of research geared toward a better understanding of the role of Nrf2 in cancer. This review provides an overview of (1) the Nrf2–Keap1 signaling pathway, (2) the dual role of Nrf2 in cancer, (3) the molecular basis of Nrf2 activation in cancer cells, and (4) the challenges in the development of Nrf2-based drugs for chemoprevention and chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {Over the past 4 years, nearly 100 exome sequencing studies have revealed the high frequency of mutations in the genes encoding the subunits of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers in human cancer. Most of these mutations are within the genes encoding subunits of the BAF (Brg/Brahma-associated factors) or mSWI/SNF complex, which is one of two dozen predicted ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes in mammals. Considering BAF complexes as a single entity, the 15 subunits encoded by 29 genes are mutated in {$>$}20\% of human cancer, across a broad range of tumor types. These observations demonstrate that there is little redundancy in the oncogenic function of BAF complexes with the other remodeling complexes, underscoring their unique roles. Several important conclusions emerge from these genomic data: specific subunits appear to be mutated in specific cancers, highlighting tissue-specific protective roles; mutations can function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes; mutations can be homozygous or, more commonly, heterozygous, implying their dosage-sensitive roles in an unknown yet fundamental process used to suppress the genesis of cancer. These new human genetic findings paired with biochemical studies are challenging old ideas on how chromatin remodeling complexes function, generating new hypotheses with respect to their normal and oncogenic mechanisms and highlighting potential avenues for therapeutic intervention in human cancer.},

Paired box family protein 8 (PAX8) has been described as a transcription factor highly specific to neoplasms derived from Mullerian organs, thyroid, and kidney. PAX8 IHC with polyclonal and monoclonal antibody reagents was performed on 27 primary and 22 metastatic breast carcinomas. Eight of 27 primary breast carcinomas (30\%) were positive for PAX8 with the monoclonal antibody reagent only; 0 of 22 were polyclonal anti-PAX8 immunoreactive. Substantial numbers of metastases had positive immunoreactivity for polyclonal anti-PAX8 (23\%). Each of these metastases and additional cases (45\% total) also had positive immunoreactivity for monoclonal anti-PAX8, including 5 of 7 brain metastases. IHC with monoclonal anti-PAX8 was positive on 6 of 7 primary breast carcinomas corresponding to PAX8-positive metastases. Together, these results indicate a significant fraction of breast carcinoma metastases and corresponding primary neoplasms have immunoreactivity for PAX8, and positivity rates depend on the antibody used. Diagnoses of metastatic breast carcinoma were achieved with the aid of clinical history and additional IHC in cases of PAX8 immunoreactivity. Contextual interpretation is imperative for PAX8 IHC, particularly when the differential diagnosis includes metastatic breast carcinoma with limited diagnostic material available.},

  abstract = {Interleukin-22 (IL-22), one of the cytokines secreted by T-helper 17 (Th17) cells, binds to a class II cytokine receptor containing an IL-22 receptor 1 (IL-22R1) and IL-10R2 and influences a variety of immune reactions. IL-22 has also been shown to modulate cell cycle and proliferation mediators such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms of IL-22 in tumorigenesis. In this paper, we propose that IL-22 has a crucial role to play in controlling epithelial cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in the breast. IL-22 increased MAP3K8 phosphorylation through IL-22R1, followed by the induction of MEK-ERK, JNK-c-Jun, and STAT3 signaling pathways. Furthermore, IL-22-IL-22R1 signaling pathway activated activator protein-1 and HER2 promoter activity. In addition, Pin1 was identified as a key positive regulator for the phosphorylation-dependent MEK, c-Jun and STAT3 activity induced by IL-22. Pin1−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) exhibited significantly a decrease in IL-22-induced MEK1/2, c-Jun, and STAT3 phosphorylation compared with Pin1+/+ MEF. In addition, a knockdown of Pin1 prevented phosphorylation induced by IL-22. The in vivo chorioallantoic membrane assay also showed that IL-22 increased tumor formation of JB6 Cl41 cells. Moreover, the knockdown of MAP3K8 and Pin1 attenuated tumorigenicity of MCF7 cells. Consistent with these observations, IL-22 levels positively correlate with MAP3K8 and Pin1 expression in human breast cancer. Overall, our findings point to a critical role for the IL-22-induced MAP3K8 signaling pathway in promoting cancer-associated inflammation in the tumor microenvironment.},

We report here that up-regulation of ERG transcript is sufficient for the initiation of prostate neoplasia. In agreement with measurements of ERG transcripts, we found that ERG protein is expressed in neoplastic human prostate epithelium. Overexpression of ERG in prostate cell lines increased cell invasion. Moreover, targeted expression of this transcript in vivo in luminal prostate epithelial cells of transgenic mice results in initiation of prostate neoplasia observed as the development of focal precancerous prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Similar to human cancers, luminal epithelial cells in these PIN lesions displace diminishing in numbers basal epithelial cells and establish direct contact with the stromal cell compartment. Loss of basal cells is considered to be one of the critical hallmarks of human prostate cancer; however, the mechanisms responsible for this event were unknown. We propose that up-regulation of ERG in human prostate cancer activates cell invasion programs that subsequently displace basal cells by neoplastic epithelium. Our data demonstrate that ERG plays an important causal role in the transformation of prostate epithelium and should be considered as a target for prevention or early therapeutic intervention.},

  abstract = {Metastatic cancer in adults usually has a fatal outcome. In contrast, advanced testicular germ cell tumours are cured in over 80\% of patients using cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy [1]. An understanding of why these cells are sensitive to chemotherapeutic drugs is likely to have implications for the treatment of other types of cancer. Earlier measurements indicate that testis tumour cells are hypersensitive to cisplatin and have a low capacity to remove cisplatin-induced DNA damage from the genome [2], [3]. We have investigated the nucleotide excision repair (NER) capacity of extracts from the well-defined 833K and GCT27 human testis tumour cell lines. Both had a reduced ability to carry out the incision steps of NER in comparison with extracts from known repair-proficient cells. Immunoblotting revealed that the testis tumour cells had normal amounts of most NER proteins, but low levels of the xeroderma pigmentosum group A protein (XPA) and the ERCC1–XPF endonuclease complex. Addition of XPA specifically conferred full NER capacity on the testis tumour extracts. These results show that a low XPA level in the testis tumour cell lines is sufficient to explain their poor ability to remove cisplatin adducts from DNA and might be a major reason for the high cisplatin sensitivity of testis tumours. Targeted inhibition of XPA could sensitise other types of cells and tumours to cisplatin and broaden the usefulness of this chemotherapeutic agent.},

  abstract = {Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs during development and cancer progression to metastasis and results in enhanced cell motility and invasion. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) induces EMT through Smads, leading to transcriptional regulation, and through non-Smad pathways. We observe that TGF-β induces increased cell size and protein content during EMT. This translational regulation results from activation by TGF-β of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt, leading to the phosphorylation of S6 kinase 1 and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E–binding protein 1, which are direct regulators of translation initiation. Rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR complex 1, inhibits the TGF-β–induced translation pathway and increase in cell size without affecting the EMT phenotype. Additionally, rapamycin decreases the migratory and invasive behavior of cells that accompany TGF-β–induced EMT. The TGF-β–induced translation pathway through mTOR complements the transcription pathway through Smads. Activation of mTOR by TGF-β, which leads to increased cell size and invasion, adds to the role of TGF-β–induced EMT in cancer progression and may represent a therapeutic opportunity for rapamycin analogues in cancer.},

  abstract = {Focal copy-number amplification is an oncogenic event. Although recent studies have revealed the complex structure1-3 and the evolutionary trajectories4 of oncogene amplicons, their origin remains poorly understood. Here we show that focal amplifications in breast cancer frequently derive from a mechanism-which we term translocation-bridge amplification-involving inter-chromosomal translocations that lead to dicentric chromosome bridge formation and breakage. In 780 breast cancer genomes, we observe that focal amplifications are frequently connected to each other by inter-chromosomal translocations at their boundaries. Subsequent analysis indicates the following model: the oncogene neighbourhood is translocated in G1 creating a dicentric chromosome, the dicentric chromosome is replicated, and as dicentric sister chromosomes segregate during mitosis, a chromosome bridge is formed and then broken, with fragments often being circularized in extrachromosomal DNAs. This model explains the amplifications of key oncogenes, including ERBB2 and CCND1. Recurrent amplification boundaries and rearrangement hotspots correlate with oestrogen receptor binding in breast cancer cells. Experimentally, oestrogen treatment induces DNA double-strand breaks in the oestrogen receptor target regions that are repaired by translocations, suggesting a role of oestrogen in generating the initial translocations. A pan-cancer analysis reveals tissue-specific biases in mechanisms initiating focal amplifications, with the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle prevalent in some and the translocation-bridge amplification in others, probably owing to the different timing of DNA break repair. Our results identify a common mode of oncogene amplification and propose oestrogen as its mechanistic origin in breast cancer.},

Here, we attempted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these effects by identifying gene expression alterations in cancer cells forming hepatic metastases after myeloid cell depletion. Hepatic metastases are heavily infiltrated by CD11b+ myeloid cells. We established hepatic metastases in transgenic CD11b‐diphtheria toxin receptor mice by intrasplenic injection of MC38 colon and Lewis lung carcinoma cells before depleting myeloid cells with diphtheria toxin. Myeloid cell depletion inhibited metastatic growth with a marked diminishment of tumor vasculature. Expression of ANGPTL7 (angiopoietin‐like 7), a protein not previously linked to metastasis, was highly up‐regulated in cancer cells after myeloid cell depletion. This effect was duplicated in tissue culture, where coculture of cancer cells with tumor‐conditioned myeloid cells from liver metastases or myeloid cell conditioned media down‐regulated ANGPTL7 expression. Analogous to myeloid cell depletion, overexpression of ANGPTL7 in cancer cells significantly reduced hepatic metastasis formation and angiogenesis. We found that ANGPTL7 itself has strong antiangiogenic effects in vitro. Furthermore, analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas colorectal and breast cancer data sets revealed striking ANGPTL7 underexpression in cancerous compared to normal tissues. Also, ANGPTL7 was down‐regulated in metastatic liver colonies of colorectal cancer patients compared to their adjacent liver tissue. Conclusion: Myeloid cells promote liver metastasis by down‐regulating ANGPTL7 expression in cancer cells; our findings implicate ANGPTL7 as a mediator of metastatic progression and a potential target for interference with liver metastases.

Studies to identify the genes in the nucleotide excision repair pathway most closely associated with resistance to cisplatin have not been conclusive. We hypothesized that Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A (XPA), because of its dual role in sensing and recruiting other DNA repair proteins to the damaged template, would be critical in defining sensitivity to cisplatin. Studies were conducted to identify factors regulating transcription of XPA, to assess its role in modulating sensitivity to cisplatin and its expression in primary lung tumors. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1α) subunit was found to bind with strong affinity to a hypoxia response element sequence in the promoter of XPA. Modulating expression of HIF1α by small interfering RNA or cobalt chloride markedly reduced or increased transcription of XPA in lung cancer cell lines, respectively. Protein levels of XPA were strongly correlated with sensitivity to cisplatin ( r = 0.88; P \&lt; 0.001) in cell lines and sensitivity could be increased by small interfering RNA depletion of XPA. Expression of XPA determined in 54 primary lung tumors was elevated on average 5.2-fold when compared with normal bronchial epithelial cells and correlated with levels of HIF1α ( r = 0.58; P \&lt; 0.01). Together, these studies identify XPA as a novel target for regulation by HIF1α whose modulation could impact lung cancer therapy.},

In this study, we offer genetic evidence that the apoptotic response of neoplastically transformed cells to DNA damage requires RhoB, a member of the Rho family of actin cytoskeletal regulators. Targeted deletion of the rhoB gene did not affect cell cycle arrest in either normal or transformed cells after exposure to doxorubicin or gamma irradiation, but rendered transformed cells resistant to apoptosis. This effect was specific insofar as rhoB deletion did not affect apoptotic susceptibility to agents that do not damage DNA. However, rhoB deletion also affected apoptotic susceptibility to Taxol, an agent that disrupts microtubule dynamics. We have demonstrated that RhoB alteration mediates the proapoptotic and antineoplastic effects of farnesyltransferase inhibitors, and we show here that RhoB alteration is also crucial for farnesyltransferase inhibitors to sensitize neoplastic cells to DNA damage-induced cell death. We found RhoB to be an important determinant of long-term survival in vitro and tumor response in vivo after gamma irradiation. Our findings identify a pivotal role for RhoB in the apoptotic response of neoplastic cells to DNA damage at a novel regulatory point that may involve the actin cytoskeleton.},

Aberrant regulation of GSK3β has been implicated in a range of human pathologies including non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, some neurodegenerative diseases, and bipolar disorder. As a consequence, the therapeutic potential of GSK3β inhibitors has become an important area of investigation. However, GSK3β also participates in neoplastic transformation and tumor development.

GSK3β also mediates drug sensitivity/resistance in cancer chemotherapy.

  abstract = {Investigations into the function of nonpromoter DNA methylation have yielded new insights into epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of distinguishing between DNA methylation in discrete functional regions; however, integrated nonpromoter DNA methylation and gene expression analyses across a wide number of tumor types and corresponding normal tissues have not been performed. Through integrated analysis of gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, we examined 32 tumor types and identified 57 tumor suppressors and oncogenes out of 260 genes exhibiting a correlation of \&gt; 0.5 between gene body methylation and gene expression in at least one tumor type. The lymphocyte-specific gene CARD11 exhibits robust association between gene body methylation and expression across 19 of 32 tumor types examined. It is significantly overexpressed in kidney renal cell carcinoma (KIRC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumor tissues in comparison with respective control samples; and is significantly associated with lower overall survival in KIRC. Contrary to its canonical function in lymphocyte NFκB activation, CARD11 activates the mTOR pathway in KIRC and LUAD, resulting in suppressed autophagy. Furthermore, demethylation of a CpG island within the gene body of CARD11 decreases gene expression. Collectively, our study highlights how DNA methylation outside the promoter region can impact tumor progression.Our study describes a novel regulatory role of gene body DNA methylation–dependent CARD11 expression on mTOR signaling and its impact on tumor progression.},

Components of these pathways were among the first to be discovered when scientists began cloning proto-oncogenes and purifying cellular kinase activities in the 1980s. Ras-ERK and PI3K-mTOR were originally modeled as linear signaling conduits activated by different stimuli, yet even early experiments hinted that they might intersect to regulate each other and co-regulate downstream functions.

  abstract = {CAPER is an estrogen receptor (ER) co-activator that was recently shown to be involved in human breast cancer pathogenesis. Indeed, we reported increased expression of CAPER in human breast cancer specimens. We demonstrated that CAPER was undetectable or expressed at relatively low levels in normal breast tissue and assumed a cytoplasmic distribution. In contrast, CAPER was expressed at higher levels in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) specimens, where it assumed a predominantly nuclear distribution. However, the functional role of CAPER in human breast cancer initiation and progression remained unknown. Here, we used a lentiviral-mediated gene silencing approach to reduce the expression of CAPER in the ER-positive human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. The proliferation and tumorigenicity of MCF-7 cells stably expressing control or human CAPER shRNAs was then determined via both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Knockdown of CAPER expression significantly reduced the proliferation of MCF-7 cells in vitro. Importantly, nude mice injected with MCF-7 cells harboring CAPER shRNAs developed smaller tumors than mice injected with MCF-7 cells harboring control shRNAs. Mechanistically, tumors derived from mice injected with MCF-7 cells harboring CAPER shRNAs displayed reduced expression of the cell cycle regulators PCNA, MCM7, and cyclin D1, and the protein synthesis marker 4EBP1. In conclusion, knockdown of CAPER expression markedly reduced human breast cancer cell proliferation in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Mechanistically, knockdown of CAPER abrogated the activity of proliferative and protein synthesis pathways.},

  abstract = {Current targeted cancer therapies are largely guided by mutations of a single gene, which overlooks concurrent genomic alterations. Here, we show that RNASEH2B, RB1, and BRCA2, three closely located genes on chromosome 13q, are frequently deleted in prostate cancer individually or jointly. Loss of RNASEH2B confers cancer cells sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition due to impaired ribonucleotide excision repair and PARP trapping. When co-deleted with RB1, however, cells lose their sensitivity, in part, through E2F1-induced BRCA2 expression, thereby enhancing homologous recombination repair capacity. Nevertheless, loss of BRCA2 resensitizes RNASEH2B/RB1 co-deleted cells to PARP inhibition. Our results may explain some of the disparate clinical results from PARP inhibition due to interaction between multiple genomic alterations and support a comprehensive genomic test to determine who may benefit from PARP inhibition. Last, we show that ATR inhibition can disrupt E2F1-induced BRCA2 expression and overcome PARP inhibitor resistance caused by RB1 loss.},

We previously showed that accumulation of the oncometabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), in breast tumors was associated with MYC signaling, but not with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations, suggesting a distinct mechanism for increased 2HG in breast cancer. Here, we determined that D-2HG is the predominant enantiomer in human breast tumors and show that the D-2HG-producing mitochondrial enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase, iron-containing protein 1 (ADHFE1), is a breast cancer oncogene that decreases patient survival. We found that MYC upregulates ADHFE1 through changes in iron metabolism while coexpression of both ADHFE1 and MYC strongly enhanced orthotopic tumor growth in MCF7 cells. Moreover, ADHFE1 promoted metabolic reprogramming with increased formation of D-2HG and reactive oxygen, a reductive glutamine metabolism, and modifications of the epigenetic landscape, leading to cellular dedifferentiation, enhanced mesenchymal transition, and phenocopying alterations that occur with high D-2HG levels in cancer cells with IDH mutations. Together, our data support the hypothesis that ADHFE1 and MYC signaling contribute to D-2HG accumulation in breast tumors and show that D-2HG is an oncogenic metabolite and potential driver of disease progression.},

  abstract = {During development of the ventral spinal cord, the V2 interneurons emerge from p2 progenitors and diversify into two major subtypes, V2a and V2b, that play key roles in locomotor coordination. Dll4-mediated Notch activation in a subset of p2 precursors constitutes the crucial first step towards generating neuronal diversity in this domain. The mechanism behind the asymmetric Notch activation and downstream signaling events are, however, unknown at present. We show here that the Ascl1 and Neurog basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proneural factors are expressed in a mosaic pattern in p2 progenitors and that Foxn4 is required for setting and maintaining this expression mosaic. By binding directly to a conserved Dll4 enhancer, Foxn4 and Ascl1 activate Dll4 expression, whereas Neurog proteins prevent this effect, thereby resulting in asymmetric activation of Dll4 expression in V2 precursors expressing different combinations of proneural and Foxn4 transcription factors. Lineage tracing using the Cre-LoxP system reveals selective expression of Dll4 in V2a precursors, whereas Dll4 expression is initially excluded from V2b precursors. We provide evidence that BMP/TGFβ signaling is activated in V2b precursors and that Dll4-mediated Notch signaling is responsible for this activation. Using a gain-of-function approach and by inhibiting BMP/TGFβ signal transduction with pathway antagonists and RNAi knockdown, we further demonstrate that BMP/TGFβ signaling is both necessary and sufficient for V2b fate specification. Our data together thus suggest that the mosaic expression of Foxn4 and proneural factors may serve as the trigger to initiate asymmetric Dll4-Notch and subsequent BMP/TGFβ signaling events required for neuronal diversity in the V2 domain.},

  abstract = {The vaccinia-related kinases (VRKs) comprise a branch of the casein kinase family. VRK1, a ser/thr kinase with a nuclear localization, is the most well-studied paralog and has been described as a proproliferative protein. In lower eukaryotes, a loss of VRK1 activity is associated with severe mitotic and meiotic defects. Mice that are hypomorphic for VRK1 expression are infertile, and depletion of VRK1 in tissue culture cells can impair cell proliferation and alter several signaling pathways. VRK1 has been implicated as part of a ‘gene-expression signature’ whose overexpression correlates with poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients. We present here our investigation of the role of VRK1 in the growth of normal (MCF10) and malignant (MDA-MB-231) human mammary epithelial cells, and demonstrate that shRNA-mediated depletion of VRK1 slows their proliferation significantly. Conversely, stable overexpression of a FLAG-tagged VRK1 transgene imparts a survival advantage to highly malignant MDA-MB-231 cells under conditions of nutrient and growth factor deprivation. Moreover, in a murine orthotopic xenograft model of breast cancer, we demonstrate that tumors depleted of VRK1 show a 50\% reduction in size from 4–13 weeks postengraftment. The incidence and burden of distal metastases in the lungs and brain was also significantly reduced in mice engrafted with VRK1-depleted cells. These studies demonstrate that VRK1 depletion or overexpression has an impact on the proliferation and survival of cell lines derived from normal or malignant mammary tissue, and moreover show that depletion of VRK1 in MDA-MB-231 cells reduces their oncogenic and metastatic properties in vivo.},

Trastuzumab sensitivity was restored by siRNA knockdown of these genes in the resistant cells, and overexpression of 5 of the 25 genes was found in at least one of five refractory HER2\,+\,breast cancer. In summary, our rigorous computational approach, followed by experimental validation, significantly implicate ATF4, CHEK2, ENAH, ICOSLG, and RAD51 as potential biomarkers of trastuzumab resistance.

Here, we assembled MSK-MET, a pan-cancer cohort of over 25,000 patients with metastatic diseases. By analyzing genomic and clinical data from this cohort, we identified associations between genomic alterations and patterns of metastatic dissemination across 50 tumor types. We found that chromosomal instability is strongly correlated with metastatic burden in some tumor types, including prostate adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and HR+/HER2+ breast ductal carcinoma, but not in others, including colorectal cancer and high-grade serous ovarian cancer, where copy-number alteration patterns may be established early in tumor development. We also identified somatic alterations associated with metastatic burden and specific target organs. Our data offer a valuable resource for the investigation of the biological basis for metastatic spread and highlight the complex role of chromosomal instability in cancer progression.},

  abstract = {MERTK, a member of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK) receptor tyrosine kinases, has complex and diverse roles in cell biology. On the one hand, knock-out of MERTK results in age-dependent autoimmunity characterized by failure of apoptotic cell clearance, while on the other, MERTK overexpression in cancer drives classical oncogene pathways leading to cell transformation. To better understand the interplay between cell transformation and efferocytosis, we stably expressed MERTK in human MCF10A cells, a non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line devoid of endogenous MERTK. While stable expression of MERTK in MCF10A resulted in enhanced motility and AKT-mediated chemoprotection, MERTK-10A cells did not form stable colonies in soft agar, or enhance proliferation compared with parental MCF10A cells. Concomitant to chemoresistance, MERTK also stimulated efferocytosis in a gain-of-function capacity. However, unlike AXL, MERTK activation was highly dependent on apoptotic cells, suggesting MERTK may preferentially interface with phosphatidylserine. Consistent with this idea, knockdown of MERTK in breast cancer cells MDA-MB 231 reduced efferocytosis, while transient or stable expression of MERTK stimulated apoptotic cell clearance in all cell lines tested. Moreover, human breast cancer cells with higher endogenous MERTK showed higher levels of efferocytosis that could be blocked by soluble TAM receptors. Finally, through MERTK, apoptotic cells induced PD-L1 expression, an immune checkpoint blockade, suggesting that cancer cells may adopt MERTK-driven efferocytosis as an immune suppression mechanism for their advantage. These data collectively identify MERTK as a significant link between cancer progression and efferocytosis, and a potentially unrealized tumor-promoting event when MERTK is overexpressed in epithelial cells.},

We found that 93 protein-coding cancer genes carried probable driver mutations. Some non-coding regions exhibited high mutation frequencies, but most have distinctive structural features probably causing elevated mutation rates and do not contain driver mutations. Mutational signature analysis was extended to genome rearrangements and revealed twelve base substitution and six rearrangement signatures. Three rearrangement signatures, characterized by tandem duplications or deletions, appear associated with defective homologous-recombination-based DNA repair: one with deficient BRCA1 function, another with deficient BRCA1 or BRCA2 function, the cause of the third is unknown. This analysis of all classes of somatic mutation across exons, introns and intergenic regions highlights the repertoire of cancer genes and mutational processes operating, and progresses towards a comprehensive account of the somatic genetic basis of breast cancer.},

  abstract = {Cancer evolves dynamically as clonal expansions supersede one another driven by shifting selective pressures, mutational processes, and disrupted cancer genes. These processes mark the genome, such that a cancer's life history is encrypted in the somatic mutations present. We developed algorithms to decipher this narrative and applied them to 21 breast cancers. Mutational processes evolve across a cancer's lifespan, with many emerging late but contributing extensive genetic variation. Subclonal diversification is prominent, and most mutations are found in just a fraction of tumor cells. Every tumor has a dominant subclonal lineage, representing more than 50\% of tumor cells. Minimal expansion of these subclones occurs until many hundreds to thousands of mutations have accumulated, implying the existence of long-lived, quiescent cell lineages capable of substantial proliferation upon acquisition of enabling genomic changes. Expansion of the dominant subclone to an appreciable mass may therefore represent the final rate-limiting step in a breast cancer's development, triggering diagnosis. PaperClip},

  abstract = {One of the major challenges in defining clinically-relevant and less heterogeneous tumor subtypes is assigning biological and/or clinical interpretations to etiological (intrinsic) subtypes. Conventional clustering/subtyping approaches often fail to define such subtypes, as they involve several discrete steps. Here we demonstrate a unique machine-learning method, phenotype mapping (PhenMap), which jointly integrates single omics data with phenotypic information using three published breast cancer datasets (n = 2045). The PhenMap framework uses a modified factor analysis method that is governed by a key assumption that, features from different omics data types are correlated due to specific "hidden/mapping" variables (context-specific mapping variables (CMV)). These variables can be simultaneously modeled with phenotypic data as covariates to yield functional subtypes and their associated features (e.g., genes) and phenotypes. In one example, we demonstrate the identification and validation of six novel "functional" (discrete) subtypes with differential responses to a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6 inhibitor and etoposide by jointly integrating transcriptome profiles with four different drug response data from 37 breast cancer cell lines. These robust subtypes are also present in patient breast tumors with different prognosis. In another example, we modeled patient gene expression profiles and clinical covariates together to identify continuous subtypes with clinical/biological implications. Overall, this genome-phenome machine-learning integration tool, PhenMap identifies functional and phenotype-integrated discrete or continuous subtypes with clinical translational potential.},

However, the heterogeneity of the gastric tumors and its resistance to the drugs, make in some cases the response very low and the prognosis unpredictable. In this manuscript we aim to find the molecular processes involved in cisplatin-induced apoptosis in two gastric cancer cell lines with different sensitivity to the treatment: AGS and MKN45. The apoptosis induction is higher in MKN45 than in AGS cells in response to CDDP. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway study revealed that MKN45 cells undergo degradation of Mcl-1 together with an increase of Bid and Bad levels, which results in sensitivity to CDDP. In addition, DNA repair NER pathway is impair in MKN45 cells due to low levels of XPC and the absence of translocation of XPA and XPD to the nucleus after stimuli. Altogether, these results suggest that NER and Bcl-2 protein family proteins are potential targets to improve the response to cisplatin treatment.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Autophagy has a dual role in the maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs), but the precise relationship between autophagy and cancer stemness requires further investigation. In this study, it was found that luminal and triple-negative breast cancers require distinct therapeutic approaches because of their different amounts of autophagy flux. We identified that autophagy flux was inhibited in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) CSCs. Moreover, miRNA-181a (miR-181a) expression is upregulated in both TNBC CSCs and patient tissues. Autophagy-related 5 (ATG5) and autophagy-related 2B (ATG2B) participate in the early formation of autophagosomes and were revealed as targets of miR-181a. Inhibition of miR-181a expression led to attenuation of TNBC stemness and an increase in autophagy flux. Furthermore, treatment with curcumin led to attenuation of cancer stemness in TNBC CSCs; the expression of ATG5 and ATG2B was enhanced and there was an increase of autophagy flux. These results indicated that ATG5 and ATG2B are involved in the suppression of cancer stemness in TNBC. In summary, autophagy inhibits cancer stemness through the miR-181a-regulated mechanism in TNBC. Promoting tumor-suppressive autophagy using curcumin may be a potential method for the treatment of TNBC.},

  abstract = {The GATA4 transcription factor acts as a master regulator of development of multiple tissues. GATA4 also acts in a distinct capacity to control a stress-inducible pro-inflammatory secretory program that is associated with senescence, a potent tumor suppression mechanism, but also operates in non-senescent contexts such as tumorigenesis. This secretory pathway is composed of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors, and proteases. Since GATA4 is deleted or epigenetically silenced in cancer, here we examine the role of GATA4 in tumorigenesis in mouse models through both loss-of-function and overexpression experiments. We find that GATA4 promotes non-cell autonomous tumor suppression in multiple model systems. Mechanistically, we show that Gata4-dependent tumor suppression requires cytotoxic CD8 T cells and partially requires the secreted chemokine CCL2. Analysis of transcriptome data in human tumors reveals reduced lymphocyte infiltration in GATA4-deficient tumors, consistent with our murine data. Notably, activation of the GATA4-dependent secretory program combined with an~anti-PD-1 antibody robustly abrogates tumor growth in vivo.},

S6K1 amplification and protein overexpression have earlier been associated with a worse outcome in breast cancer, but information regarding S6K2 is scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic and treatment predictive relevance of S6K1/S6K2 gene amplification, as well as S6K2 protein expression in breast cancer. S6K1/S6K2 gene copy number was determined by real-time PCR in 207 stage II breast tumors and S6K2 protein expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry in 792 node-negative breast cancers. S6K1 amplification/gain was detected in 10.7\%/21.4\% and S6K2 amplification/gain in 4.3\%/21.3\% of the tumors. S6K2 protein was detected in the nucleus (38\%) and cytoplasm (76\%) of the tumor cells. S6K1 amplification was significantly associated with HER2 gene amplification and protein expression. S6K2 amplification correlated significantly with high S6K2 mRNA levels, ER+ status and CCND1 amplification. S6K1 and S6K2 gene amplification was associated with a worse prognosis independent of HER2 and CCND1. S6K2 gain and nuclear S6K2 expression was related to an improved benefit from tamoxifen among patients with ER+, respectively ER+/PgR+ tumors. In the ER+/PgR− subgroup, nuclear S6K2 rather indicated decreased tamoxifen responsiveness. S6K1 amplification predicted reduced benefit from radiotherapy. This is the first study showing that S6K2 amplification and overexpression, like S6K1 amplification, have prognostic and treatment predictive significance in breast cancer.},

This response was also seen for TGF-beta-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. TGF-beta induction of key target genes involved in bone metastasis, were found to be dependent on Smad3 but not Smad2. Strikingly, whereas knockdown of Smad3 in MDA-MB-231 resulted in prolonged latency and delayed growth of bone metastasis, Smad2 knockdown resulted in a more aggressive phenotype compared with control MDA-MB-231 cells. Consistent with differential effects of Smad knockdown on TGF-beta-induced VEGF expression, these opposing effects of Smad2 versus Smad3 could be directly correlated with divergence in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis in vivo. Thus, Smad2 and Smad3 differentially affect breast cancer bone metastasis formation in vivo.},

  abstract = {Homologous recombination (HR) is a major pathway for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks in mammalian cells, the defining step of which is homologous strand exchange directed by the RAD51 protein. The physiological importance of HR is underscored by the observation of genomic instability in HR-deficient cells and, importantly, the association of cancer predisposition and developmental defects with mutations in HR genes. The tumor suppressors BRCA1 and BRCA2, key players at different stages of HR, are frequently mutated in familial breast and ovarian cancers. Other HR proteins, including PALB2 and RAD51 paralogs, have also been identified as tumor suppressors. This review summarizes recent findings on BRCA1, BRCA2, and associated proteins involved in human disease with an emphasis on their molecular roles and interactions.},

  abstract = {Metastatic progression is regulated by metastasis promoter and suppressor genes.~NME1, the prototypic and first described metastasis suppressor gene, encodes a nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) involved in nucleotide metabolism; two related family members, NME2 and NME4, are also reported as metastasis suppressors. These proteins physically interact with members of the GTPase dynamin family, which have key functions in membrane fission and fusion reactions necessary for endocytosis and mitochondrial dynamics. Evidence supports a model in which NDPKs provide GTP to dynamins to maintain a high local GTP concentration for optimal dynamin function. NME1 and NME2 are cytosolic enzymes that provide GTP to dynamins at the plasma membrane, which drive endocytosis, suggesting that these NMEs are necessary to attenuate signaling by receptors on the cell surface. Disruption of NDPK activity in NME-deficient tumors may thus drive metastasis by prolonging signaling. NME4 is a mitochondrial enzyme that interacts with the dynamin OPA1 at the mitochondria inner membrane to drive inner membrane fusion and maintain a fused mitochondrial network. This function is consistent with the current view that mitochondrial fusion inhibits the metastatic potential of tumor cells whereas mitochondrial fission promotes metastasis progression. The roles of NME family members in dynamin-mediated endocytosis and mitochondrial dynamics and the intimate link between these processes and metastasis provide a new framework to understand the metastasis suppressor functions of NME proteins.},

Here, we report that RBM39 functions as a master transcriptional regulator that interacts with the MLL1 complex to facilitate chromatin binding and H3K4 trimethylation in breast cancer cells. We identify RBM39 functional domains required for DNA and complex binding and show that the loss of RBM39 has widespread effects on H3K4me3 and gene expression, including key oncogenic pathways. RBM39’s RNA recognition motif 3 (RRM3) functions as a dominant-negative domain; namely, it disrupts the complex and H3K4me trimethylation and expression of RBM/MLL1 target genes. RRM3-derived cell-penetrating peptides phenocopy the effects of the loss of RBM39 to decrease growth and survival of all major subtypes of breast cancer and yet are nontoxic to normal cells. These findings establish RBM39/MLL1 as a major contributor to the abnormal epigenetic landscape in breast cancer and lay the~foundation for peptide-mediated cancer-specific therapy based on disruption of RBM39 epigenomic functions.},

Activation of Akt phosphorylates GSK3β preventing phosphorylation of cyclin D1 which leads to accumulation and nuclear localisation of cyclin D1, activation of CDK4/6 and cell cycle progression. The CCND1 gene found at chromosome 11q13 has been shown to be amplified in approximately 15~\% of breast cancers. Cyclin D1, the product of the CCND1 gene, is one of the most commonly overexpressed proteins in breast cancer. Protein expression for GSK3β, phosphorylated-GSK3β (p-GSK3β), cyclin D1 and gene expression of CCND1 were examined in tissue microarrays of 1,686 patients from the Edinburgh Breast Conservation Series. High GSK3β expression was associated with reduced distant relapse-free survival (DRFS), while no association between p-GSK3β and breast cancer-specific survival was seen. CCND1 amplification is also associated with poor DRFS. On the contrary, cyclin D1 overexpression is associated with an increase in DRFS. Multivariate analysis was performed. We suggest that analysis of both GSK3β and cyclin D1 expressions can be considered as a marker of good prognosis in early breast cancer.},

Here we demonstrate the analytical development and validation of a custom NanoString nCounter platform-based biomarker assay (NanoCRCA) to stratify CRCs into subtypes. To reduce costs, we switched from the standard nCounter protocol to a custom modified protocol. The assay included a reduced 38-gene panel that was selected using an in-house machine-learning~pipeline. We applied NanoCRCA to 413 samples from 355 CRC patients. From the fresh frozen samples (n\,=\,237), a subset had matched microarray/RNAseq profiles (n\,=\,47) or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples (n\,=\,58). We also analyzed a further 118 FFPE samples. We compared the assay results with the CMS classifier, different platforms (microarrays/RNAseq) and gene-set classifiers (38 and the original 786 genes). The standard and modified protocols showed high correlation ({$>$}\,0.88) for gene expression. Technical replicates were highly correlated ({$>$}\,0.96). NanoCRCA classified fresh frozen and FFPE samples into all five CRCA subtypes with consistent classification of selected matched fresh frozen/FFPE samples. We demonstrate high and significant subtype concordance across protocols (100\%), gene sets (95\%), platforms (87\%) and with CMS subtypes (75\%) when evaluated across multiple datasets. Overall, our NanoCRCA assay with further validation may facilitate prospective validation of CRC subtypes in clinical trials and beyond.},

  abstract = {The rates and routes of lethal systemic spread in breast cancer are poorly understood owing to a lack of molecularly characterized patient cohorts with long-term, detailed follow-up data. Long-term follow-up is especially important for those with oestrogen-receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers, which can recur up to two decades after initial diagnosis1–6. It is therefore essential to identify patients who have a high risk of late relapse7–9. Here we present a statistical framework that models distinct disease stages (locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, breast-cancer-related death~and death from other causes) and competing risks of mortality from breast cancer, while yielding individual risk-of-recurrence predictions. We apply this model to 3,240 patients with breast cancer, including 1,980 for whom molecular data are available, and delineate spatiotemporal patterns of relapse across different categories of molecular information (namely immunohistochemical subtypes; PAM50 subtypes, which are based on gene-expression patterns10,11; and integrative or IntClust subtypes, which are based on patterns of genomic copy-number alterations and gene expression12,13). We identify four late-recurring integrative subtypes, comprising~about one quarter (26\%) of tumours that are both positive for ER and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, each with characteristic tumour-driving alterations in genomic copy number and a high risk of recurrence (mean 47–62\%) up to 20 years after diagnosis. We also define a subgroup of triple-negative breast cancers in which cancer rarely recurs after five years, and a separate subgroup in which patients remain at risk. Use of the integrative subtypes improves the prediction of late, distant relapse beyond what is possible with clinical covariates (nodal status, tumour size, tumour grade and immunohistochemical subtype). These findings highlight opportunities for improved patient stratification and biomarker-driven clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Background Breast cancer exhibits significant molecular, pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Current clinicopathological evaluation is imperfect for predicting outcome, which results in overtreatment for many patients, and for others, leads to death from recurrent disease. Therefore, additional criteria are needed to better personalize care and maximize treatment effectiveness and survival. Methods To address these challenges, the Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network - Breast (SCAN-B) consortium was initiated in 2010 as a multicenter prospective study with longsighted aims to analyze breast cancers with next-generation genomic technologies for translational research in a population-based manner and integrated with healthcare; decipher fundamental tumor biology from these analyses; utilize genomic data to develop and validate new clinically-actionable biomarker assays; and establish real-time clinical implementation of molecular diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive tests. In the first phase, we focus on molecular profiling by next-generation RNA-sequencing on the Illumina platform. Results In the first 3~years from 30 August 2010 through 31 August 2013, we have consented and enrolled 3,979 patients with primary breast cancer at the seven hospital sites in South Sweden, representing approximately 85\% of eligible patients in the catchment area. Preoperative blood samples have been collected for 3,942 (99\%) patients and primary tumor specimens collected for 2,929 (74\%) patients. Herein we describe the study infrastructure and protocols and present initial proof of concept results from prospective RNA sequencing including tumor molecular subtyping and detection of driver gene mutations. Prospective patient enrollment is ongoing. Conclusions We demonstrate that large-scale population-based collection and RNA-sequencing analysis of breast cancer is feasible. The SCAN-B Initiative should significantly reduce the time to discovery, validation, and clinical implementation of novel molecular diagnostic and predictive tests. We welcome the participation of additional comprehensive cancer treatment centers. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02306096.

  abstract = {The problem of segmenting linearly ordered data is frequently encountered in time-series analysis, computational biology, and natural language processing. Segmentations obtained independently from replicate data sets or from the same data with different methods or parameter settings pose the problem of computing an aggregate or consensus segmentation. This Segmentation Aggregation problem amounts to finding a segmentation that minimizes the sum of distances to the input segmentations. It is again a segmentation problem and can be solved by dynamic programming. The aim of this contribution is (1) to gain a better mathematical understanding of the Segmentation Aggregation problem and its solutions and (2) to demonstrate that consensus segmentations have useful applications. Extending previously known results we show that for a large class of distance functions only breakpoints present in at least one input segmentation appear in the consensus segmentation. Furthermore, we derive a bound on the size of consensus segments. As show-case applications, we investigate a yeast transcriptome and show that consensus segments provide a robust means of identifying transcriptomic units. This approach is particularly suited for dense transcriptomes with polycistronic transcripts, operons, or a lack of separation between transcripts. As a second application, we demonstrate that consensus segmentations can be used to robustly identify growth regimes from sets of replicate growth curves.},

  abstract = {ARID1A, SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex subunit, is a recently identified tumor suppressor that is mutated in a broad spectrum of human cancers. Thus, it is of fundamental clinical importance to understand its molecular functions and determine whether ARID1A deficiency can be exploited therapeutically. In this article, we report a key function of ARID1A in regulating the DNA damage checkpoint. ARID1A is recruited to DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) via its interaction with the upstream DNA damage checkpoint kinase ATR. At the molecular level, ARID1A facilitates efficient processing of DSB to single-strand ends and sustains DNA damage signaling. Importantly, ARID1A deficiency sensitizes cancer cells to PARP inhibitors in vitro and in vivo, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for patients with ARID1A-mutant tumors.Significance:ARID1A has been identified as one of the most frequently mutated genes across human cancers. Our data suggest that clinical utility of PARP inhibitors might be extended beyond patients with BRCA mutations to a larger group of patients with ARID1A-mutant tumors, which may exhibit therapeutic vulnerability to PARP inhibitors.

  abstract = {Upon DNA damage, the amino terminus of p53 is phosphorylated at a number of serine residues including S20, a site that is particularly important in regulating stability and function of the protein. Because no known kinase has been identified that can modify this site, HeLa nuclear extracts were fractionated and S20 phosphorylation was followed. We discovered that a S20 kinase activity copurifies with the human homolog of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe checkpoint kinase, Chk1 (hCHK1). We confirmed that recombinant hCHK1, but not a kinase-defective version of hCHK1, can phosphorylate p53 in vitro at S20. Additional inducible amino- and carboxy-terminal sites in p53 are also phosphorylated by hCHK1, indicating that this is an unusually versatile protein kinase. It is interesting that hCHK1 strongly prefers tetrameric to monomeric p53 in vitro, consistent with our observation that phosphorylation of amino-terminal sites in vivo requires that p53 be oligomeric. Regulation of the levels and activity of hCHK1 in transfected cells is directly correlated with the levels of p53; expression of either a kinase-defective hCHK1 or antisense hCHK1 leads to reduced levels of cotransfected p53, whereas overexpression of wild-type hCHK1 or the kinase domain of hCHK1 results in increased levels of expressed p53 protein. The human homolog of the second S. pombe checkpoint kinase, Cds1 (CHK2/hCds1), phosphorylates tetrameric p53 but not monomeric p53 in vitro at sites similar to those phosphorylated by hCHK1 kinase, suggesting that both checkpoint kinases can play roles in regulating p53 after DNA damage.},

Here we developed a method, BISCUT, that identifies loci subject to fitness advantages or disadvantages by interrogating length distributions of telomere- or centromere-bounded copy-number events. These loci were significantly enriched for known cancer driver genes, including genes not detected through analysis of focal copy-number events, and were often lineage specific. BISCUT identified the helicase-encoding gene WRN as a haploinsufficient tumour-suppressor gene on chromosome 8p, which is supported by several lines of evidence. We also formally quantified the role of selection and mechanical biases in driving aneuploidy, finding that rates of arm-level copy-number alterations are most highly correlated with their effects on cellular fitness1,2. These results provide insight into the driving forces behind aneuploidy and its contribution to tumorigenesis.},

Trastuzumab is the first-line targeted therapeutic drug for HER2-positive breast cancer and has improved patient overall survival. However, acquired resistance to trastuzumab is still a critical issue in breast cancer treatment. We previously established a trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cell line (named as BT-474-R) from a trastuzumab-sensitive HER2-amplified cell line BT-474. Lapatinib is also a molecular-targeted drug for HER2-positive breast cancer, which acquired the resistance to trastuzumab. Acquired resistance to lapatinib is also an issue to be conquered. Methods We established trastuzumab/lapatinib-dual resistant cell line (named as BT-474-RL2) by additionally treating BT-474-R with lapatinib. We analyzed the mechanisms of resistance to trastuzumab and lapatinib. Besides, we analyzed the effect of the detected resistance mechanism in HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Results Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Yes1, which is one of the Src family members, was amplified, overexpressed and activated in BT-474-R and BT-474-RL2. Silencing of Yes1 by siRNA induced both BT-474-R and BT-474-RL2 to restore the sensitivity to trastuzumab and lapatinib. Pharmaceutical inhibition of Yes1 by the Src inhibitor dasatinib was also effective to restore the sensitivity to trastuzumab and lapatinib in the two resistant cell lines. Combination treatment with dasatinib and trastuzumab induced down-regulation of signaling molecules such as HER2 and Akt. Moreover, the combination treatments induced G1-phase cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Consistent with cell line data, high expression of Yes1 mRNA was correlated with worse prognosis in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Conclusion Yes1 plays an important role in acquired resistance to trastuzumab and lapatinib in HER2-positive breast cancer. Our data suggest that pharmacological inhibition of Yes1 may be an effective strategy to overcome resistance to trastuzumab and lapatinib.},

Integrating these new biological factors, such as plasma circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), CDX2 staining, inflammation-associated cytokines and transcriptomic consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) classification, into a multimodal approach may improve our accuracy in determining risk of recurrence. Methods One hundred and fifty patients consecutively diagnosed with localised CC were prospectively enrolled in our study. ctDNA was tracked to detect minimal residual disease by droplet digital PCR. CDX2 expression was analysed by immunostaining. Plasma levels of cytokines potentially involved in disease progression were measured using ELISAs. A 96 custom gene panel for nCounter assay was used to classify CC into colorectal cancer assigner and CMS. Results Most patients were classified into CMS4 (37\%) and CMS2 (28\%), followed by CMS1 (20\%) and CMS3 (15\%) groups. CDX2-negative tumours were enriched in CMS1 and CMS4 subtypes. In univariable analysis, prognosis was influenced by primary tumour location, stage, vascular and perineural invasion together with high interleukin-6 plasma levels at baseline, tumours belonging to CMS 1 vs CMS2 +CMS3, ctDNA presence in plasma and CDX2 loss. However, only positive ctDNA in plasma samples (HR 13.64; p=0.002) and lack of CDX2 expression (HR 23.12; p=0.001) were found to be independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival in the multivariable model.

Familial cylindromatosis is caused by mutations in a gene encoding the CYLD protein of previously unknown function. Here we show that CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB by specific tumour-necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). Loss of the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD correlates with tumorigenesis. CYLD inhibits activation of NF-kappaB by the TNFR family members CD40, XEDAR and EDAR in a manner that depends on the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD. Downregulation of CYLD by RNA-mediated interference augments both basal and CD40-mediated activation of NF-kappaB. The inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by CYLD is mediated, at least in part, by the deubiquitination and inactivation of TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and, to a lesser extent, TRAF6. These results indicate that CYLD is a negative regulator of the cytokine-mediated activation of NF-kappaB that is required for appropriate cellular homeostasis of skin appendages.},

We developed DEMETER, an analytical framework that segregates on- from off-target effects of RNAi. 769 genes were differentially required in subsets of these cell lines at a threshold of six SDs from the mean. We found predictive models for 426 dependencies (55\%) by nonlinear regression modeling considering 66,646 molecular features. Many dependencies fall into a limited number of classes, and unexpectedly, in 82\% of models, the top biomarkers were expression based. We demonstrated the basis behind one such~predictive model linking hypermethylation of the UBB ubiquitin gene to a dependency on UBC. Together, these observations provide a foundation for a cancer dependency map that facilitates the prioritization of therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), which lack receptors for estrogen, progesterone, and amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor 2, are highly aggressive. Consequently, patients diagnosed with TNBCs have reduced overall and disease-free survival rates compared to patients with other subtypes of breast cancer. TNBCs are characterized by the presence of cancer cells with mesenchymal properties, indicating that the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a major role in the progression of this disease. The EMT program has also been implicated in chemoresistance, tumor recurrence, and induction of cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. Currently, there are no targeted therapies for TNBC, and hence, it is critical to identify the novel targets to treat TNBC.},

We report on a living biobank of PDOs from metastatic, heavily pretreated colorectal and gastroesophageal cancer patients recruited in phase 1/2 clinical trials. Phenotypic and genotypic profiling of PDOs showed a high degree of similarity to the original patient tumors. Molecular profiling of tumor organoids was matched to drug-screening results, suggesting that PDOs could complement existing approaches in defining cancer vulnerabilities and improving treatment responses. We compared responses to anticancer agents ex vivo in organoids and PDO-based orthotopic mouse tumor xenograft models with the responses of the patients in clinical trials. Our data suggest that PDOs can recapitulate patient responses in the clinic and could be implemented in personalized medicine programs.},

  abstract = {Despite showing clinical activity in BRAF-mutant melanoma, the MEK inhibitor (MEKi) trametinib has failed to show clinical benefit in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer. To identify mechanisms of resistance to MEKi, we employed a pharmacogenomic analysis of MEKi-sensitive versus MEKi-resistant colorectal cancer cell lines. Strikingly, interferon- and inflammatory-related gene sets were enriched in cell lines exhibiting intrinsic and acquired resistance to MEK inhibition. The bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 suppressed interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression and in combination with MEK inhibitors displayed synergistic effects and induced apoptosis in MEKi-resistant colorectal cancer cell lines. ISG expression was confirmed in patient-derived organoid models, which displayed resistance to trametinib and were resensitized by JQ1 co-treatment. In in vivo models of colorectal cancer, combination treatment significantly suppressed tumor growth. Our findings provide a novel explanation for the limited response to MEK inhibitors in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer, known for its inflammatory nature. Moreover, the high expression of ISGs was associated with significantly reduced survival of colorectal cancer patients. Excitingly, we have identified novel therapeutic opportunities to overcome intrinsic and acquired resistance to MEK inhibition in colorectal cancer.},

To identify genes that modulate sensitivity to MAPKi, we performed genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens in two KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer cell lines treated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib. Loss of CIC, a transcriptional repressor of ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5, promoted survival in the setting of MAPKi in cancer cells derived from several lineages. ATXN1L deletion, which reduces CIC protein, or ectopic expression of ETV1, ETV4, or ETV5 also modulated sensitivity to trametinib. ATXN1L expression inversely correlates with response to MAPKi inhibition in clinical studies. These observations identify the ATXN1L-CIC-ETS transcription factor axis as a mediator of resistance to MAPKi.},

Nevertheless, most MMRd tumors do not durably respond to ICB and critical questions remain about immunosurveillance and TMB in these tumors. In the present study, we developed autochthonous mouse models of MMRd lung and colon cancer. Surprisingly, these models did not display increased T cell infiltration or ICB response, which we showed to be the result of substantial intratumor heterogeneity of mutations. Furthermore, we found that immunosurveillance shapes the clonal architecture but not the overall burden of neoantigens, and T cell responses against subclonal neoantigens are blunted. Finally, we showed that clonal, but not subclonal, neoantigen burden predicts ICB response in clinical trials of MMRd gastric and colorectal cancer. These results provide important context for understanding immune evasion in cancers with a high TMB and have major implications for therapies aimed at increasing TMB.},

  abstract = {Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) can be tumorsuppressive through the activation of the Smadmediated signaling pathway. TGF-β1 can also enhance tumor progression by stimulating epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) through additional pathways. EMT is characterized by the acquisition of a fibroblast-like cell morphology, dissolution of tight junctions, disruption of adherence junctions, and formation of actin stress fibers. There is evidence linking the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways to the induction of TGF-α1-mediated EMT. However, the role of Erk in the induction of TGF-β1-mediated EMT remains unclear. TGF-β1 treatment of normal murine mammary gland (NMuMG) epithelial cells resulted in increased gene expression of Ras, Raf, MEK1/2, and Erki/2, as shown by microarray analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Upon 24 and 48 hours of treatment with TGIF-α1, NMuMG and mouse cortical tubule (MCT) epithelial cells underwent EMT as shown by changes in cell morphology, delocalization of zonula occludens-1 and E-cadherin from cell-cell junctions, and formation of actin stress fibers. TGF-β1 treatment also resulted in increased levels of phosphorylated Erk and Erk kinase activity. Treatment with an MEK inhibitor, U0126, inhibited increased Erk phosphorylation and kinase activity, and blocked TGF-β1 -induced EMT in both cell lines. These data show that TGF-β1 induces the activation of the Erk signaling pathway, which is required for TGF-β1 -mediated EMT in vitro.},

Several lines of analysis indicate that clones seeding metastasis or relapse disseminate late from primary tumors, but continue to acquire mutations, mostly accessing the same mutational processes active in the primary tumor. Most distant metastases acquired driver mutations not seen in the primary tumor, drawing from a wider repertoire of cancer genes than early drivers.

The molecular mechanisms underlying this activation remain elusive. Here we show that G9a functions as a coactivator of the endogenous oestrogen receptor α (ERα) in breast cancer cells in a histone methylation-independent manner. G9a dimethylates ERα at K235 both in vitro and in cells. Dimethylation of ERαK235 is recognized by the Tudor domain of PHF20, which recruits the MOF histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex to ERα target gene promoters to deposit histone H4K16 acetylation promoting active transcription. Together, our data suggest the molecular mechanism by which G9a functions as an ERα coactivator. Along with the PHF20/MOF complex, G9a links the crosstalk between ERα methylation and histone acetylation that governs the epigenetic regulation of hormonal gene expression.},

Here we report that plant homeodomain finger protein 20 (PHF20) maintains NF-κB in an active state in the nucleus by inhibiting the interaction between PP2A and p65. We show that PHF20 induces canonical NF-κB signalling by increasing the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB subunit p65. In PHF20 overexpressing cells, the termination of tumour necrosis factor-induced p65 phosphorylation is impaired whereas upstream signalling events triggered by tumour necrosis factor are unaffected. This effect strictly depends on the interaction between PHF20 and methylated lysine residues of p65, which hinders recruitment of PP2A to p65, thereby maintaining p65 in a phosphorylated state. We further show that PHF20 levels correlate with p65 phosphorylation levels in human glioma specimens. Our work identifies PHF20 as a novel regulator of NF-κB activation and suggests that elevated expression of PHF20 may drive constitutive NF-κB activation in some cancers.},

Here, using unbiased whole-genome CRISPR screens and generation of co-deficient cells with TDP1 and other genes, we demonstrate that MUS81 is an important factor that mediates the generation of excess double-strand breaks (DSBs) in TDP1 KO cells. APEX1/2 are synthetic lethal with TDP1. However, deficiency of APEX1/2 does not reduce DSB formation in TDP1 KO cells. Together, our data suggest that TOP1cc can be either resolved directly by TDP1 or be converted into DSBs and repaired further by the Homologous Recombination (HR) pathway.},
